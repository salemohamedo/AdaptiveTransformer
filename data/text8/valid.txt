executed model of a railroad and the scenery through which it passes called a layout hobbyists called model <UNK> or railway <UNK> may even maintain models large enough to ride see live steam and backyard railroad model <UNK> may find enjoyment in collecting model trains building a miniature landscape for the trains to pass through or operating their own railroad albeit in miniature some older scale models reach very high prices a us ho scale model railroad layouts vary from the very stylistic sometimes just a simple circle or oval of track to the absolutely realistic where real places are

oregon usa model railway clubs exist where model railway enthusiasts meet clubs sometimes put on displays of models for the general public one rather specialist branch of railway <UNK> concentrates on larger scales and gauges most commonly using track gauges from three five to seven five inches models in these scales are usually hand built and are powered by live steam or diesel hydraulic and the engines are often powerful enough to haul even dozens of full scale human passengers one particularly famous model railway club is the tech model railroad club <UNK> at mit which in the one nine five

one which does not exist anymore <UNK> is also termed scenery building or <UNK> constructing scenery generally involves preparing a sub terrain using screen wire a lattice of cardboard strips or carved stacks of expanded <UNK> <UNK> sheets a scenery base is then applied over the sub terrain typical scenery base materials include casting plaster plaster of paris and hybrid paper pulp papier m

stains methods of power model railway engines are generally operated by low voltage dc electricity supplied via the tracks but there are exceptions such as m <UNK> and lionel corporation which use ac most of the early models made for the toy market were powered by clockwork and controlled by stop go and reverse levers on the locomotive itself although this made control crude the models were of large enough scale and robust enough that grabbing the controls as they ran around the track was quite practical various manufacturers also introduced slowing and stopping tracks that could trigger levers on the locomotive and allow reliable station stops to be performed other locomotives particularly large models used actual steam steam or clockwork driven engines are still sought by collectors early electrical models used a three rail system with the wheels resting on a metal track with metal sleepers that conducted power and a separate middle rail which provided power to a skid under the locomotive this at first apparently strange arrangement made sense at the time as the majority of materials used for railway models were metal and conductive modern plastics were not yet available and insulation was therefore a significant problem in addition the notion of accurate models had yet to evolve and toy trains and track were generally crude <UNK> representations of generic models as model accuracy became more important some model systems adopted two rail power where the wheels were isolated from each other and the two rails carried the positive and negative supply or the two sides of the ac supply other model systems such as m <UNK> instead used a set of fine metal <UNK> to replace the central rail allowing existing three rail models to use more realistic track although dc power with the positive and negative charges on the two rails is the most common method of power m <UNK> and lionel use ac power on the three rail system american flyer is another exception which used ac power on two rail track the sugar cube sized electric motor in a z scale model locomotive the entire engine is only five zero mm two long early electric trains ran on battery power because few homes in the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries were wired for electric power today inexpensive train sets running on battery power are once again becoming more common but these are generally regarded as toys and are seldom used by hobbyists battery power is also used by many garden railway and larger scale systems both because of the difficulty in obtaining reliable power supply through the rails when outdoors and because the high power consumption and thus current draw of large scale garden models is more easily and more safely met with lead acid batteries engines powered by live steam are often built in large outdoor gauges and are also readily available in g scale one six mm scale and can be found in o and h zero scale <UNK> railways produce a live steam locomotive in oo scale development of work by some very dedicated <UNK> who hand built live steam models in ho oo oo nine and n and there is even one in z in australia occasionally the topic of gasoline electric models <UNK> after real life diesel electric locomotives comes up among dedicated hobbyists and such locomotives have been sold commercially by companies such as the pilgrim locomotive works large scale petrol mechanical and even petrol hydraulic models are commercially available but these are unusual and significantly <UNK> than the more usual electrical power control the first clockwork spring drive and live steam locomotives simply ran until they ran out of power with no way for the operator to stop and restart the locomotive or to vary its speed the advent of electric powered trains which first appeared commercially in the one eight nine zero s allowed one to control the train s speed by varying the current or voltage as trains began to be powered by transformers and <UNK> more sophisticated <UNK> appeared and soon trains powered by ac started containing mechanisms that caused the train to change direction and or even go into a neutral gear when the operator <UNK> the power trains powered by dc can change direction simply by reversing polarity electric power also permits control by dividing the layout into electrically isolated blocks where trains can be slowed or stopped by lowering or cutting the power to a block dividing a layout into blocks also permitted operators to run more than one train on a layout with much less risk of a fast train catching up with and hitting a slow train blocks can also trigger signals or other animated accessories on the layout adding more realism or <UNK> to the layout three rail systems will often <UNK> one of the common rails on a section of track and use a passing train to complete the circuit and activate an accessory many modern day 
model railways use digital techniques and are computer controlled the industry standard command system is called digital command control or dcc some less common closed proprietary systems also exist in the large scales the use of radio control has become popular particularly for garden railways scales and gauges one of the smallest z scale one two two zero placed on the buffer bar of one of the largest live steam one eight model locomotives the size of the engines depends on the scale being used the four major scales used are g scale o ho in britain the similarly sized oo is used and n although there is growing interest in z somewhat different scales are used in continental europe engine sizes can vary from around seven zero zero mm two eight tall for the largest <UNK> live steam scales down to <UNK> size for the smallest ones in z scale a typical ho engine is around five zero mm two tall and one zero zero mm to three zero zero mm four to one two in length g scale because of its larger size is most often used for outdoor modelling it is easier to fit a g scale model into a garden landscape and still keep the scenery proportional to the size of the trains running through o ho and n gauge are more delicate due to their size and are used more often indoors the words scale and gauge seem at first to be used interchangeably in model railways but their meanings are different scale is the model s measurement as a proportion to the original while gauge is the measurement between the two running rails of the track at first model railways were not to scale manufacturers and hobbyists soon arrived at de facto standards for <UNK> such as gauge but trains were only a rough approximation to the real thing see nem and <UNK> official scales for the various gauges were soon drawn up but the scales were not at first at all rigidly followed and were not necessarily correctly <UNK> for the rail gauge chosen o zero gauge trains for instance operate on track that is too widely spaced while the british oo standards operate on track that is significantly too narrow most of the commercial scales also have standards that include wheel <UNK> that are too deep wheel <UNK> that are too wide and rail tracks that are too large later on groups of <UNK> became dissatisfied with these inaccuracies and developed <UNK> standards in which everything is correctly scaled these are used by dedicated <UNK> but have not generally spread to mass produced equipment in part because the inaccuracies and <UNK> properties of the commercial scales are necessary to ensure reliable operation in the hands of consumers as well as experts and also to allow for shortcuts necessary for cost control the most common scales and gauges in europe and the usa are model railway

reflective surfaces for other senses of this word see mirror disambiguation a 
mirror is a surface with good <UNK> reflection that is smooth enough to form an image the best known example is the plane mirror the most common use is in the home for personal grooming but mirrors are also used in scientific apparatus such as telescopes and lasers and in industrial machinery effect frame in this diagram plane waves reflect off a parabolic mirror to form waves converging onto a focal point in a plane mirror a parallel beam of light changes its direction as a whole whilst still remaining parallel the images formed by a plane mirror are virtual images of the same size as the original object see mirror image there are also parabolic concave mirrors where a parallel beam of light becomes a convergent beam whose rays intersect in the focus of the mirror finally there are convex mirrors where a parallel beam becomes divergent with the apparent intersection occurring behind the mirror note that spherical concave and convex mirrors do not have a single focal point as often described in high school physics text books see spherical aberration in lens optics and aberration in optical systems a beam of light reflects off a mirror at an angle of reflection that is equal to its angle of incidence that is if the beam of light is shining on a mirror s surface at a three zero angle from vertical then it reflects from the point of incidence at a three zero angle from vertical in the opposite direction image in a mirror for an object with approximate reflection symmetry a reflection in some mirror plane corresponds to a combination of a translation if the mirror is parallel to the symmetry plane of the object and otherwise a rotation about the line of intersection of the two planes by an angle which is twice the angle between the two planes a reflection in the approximate symmetry plane of the object due to the assumption this is a minor change we can apply this to the image in a mirror of say a standing person because people have approximate bilateral symmetry the image is the most realistic if it is still vertical i e if the rotation is about a vertical axis this is the case iff the mirror is vertical in this case the image of the person is in normal standing orientation and vertically in a normal position at a horizontally different position and with an orientation rotated about a vertical axis the latter except if the mirror is parallel to the approximate symmetry plane of the person in particular if one looks at one s image in a vertical mirror in left right orientation the image corresponds to a rotation by one eight zero about the vertical axis in the mirror combined with a reflection in one s approximate symmetry plane when the rotation is so obvious that it is not worth mentioning the second component in this decomposition of the effect of the mirror is sometimes emphasized by saying that a mirror reverses left and right the question is sometimes asked why does the mirror reverse left to right and not top to bottom the simple answer to this question is that it does just look in a mirror attached to the ceiling however it is not what is usually meant by the question the <UNK> means to ask why does a chiral object such as a right hand or glove appear as an object of opposite chirality left hand or glove in the mirror the answer is that chirality of the three dimensional space is dictated by the choice of the directions of the three axes when the direction of one axis is reversed as is the case in a mirror image the chirality or handedness of space changes to the opposite one if two mirrors are set side by side with say a nine zero angle between them the axes in the doubly reflected image are inverted twice and the handedness of the image is not changed in such a double mirror a right hand looks like a right hand composition early mirrors were usually a sheet of polished metal often silver or copper for example the <UNK> <UNK> most modern mirrors consist of a thin layer of aluminium deposited on a sheet of glass they are back <UNK> where the reflecting surface is viewed through the glass sheet this makes the mirror durable but lowers the image quality of the mirror due to extraneous reflections from the front surface of the glass this type of mirror reflects about eight zero of the incident light the back side of the mirror is often painted black to completely seal the metal from corrosion applications reflections in a spherical convex mirror the photographer is seen at top right viewing one s own body a mirror is used for <UNK> parts of one s body which are difficult or impossible to see directly such as the face neck or the whole body this may be to check physical appearance including clothing make up hair etc or to control applying make up shaving cutting hair fixing one s tie etc instruments telescopes and other precision instruments use front <UNK> mirrors where the reflecting surface is placed on the front surface of the glass which gives better image quality some of them use silver but most are aluminum which is more reflective at short wavelengths than silver all of these coatings are easily damaged and require special handling they reflect nine zero to nine five of the incident light when new the coatings are typically applied by vacuum deposition a protective <UNK> is usually applied before the mirror is removed from the vacuum because the coating otherwise begins to <UNK> as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air front <UNK> mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality the <UNK> of the mirror coating can be measured using a <UNK> and 
depends on the wavelength of light as well as the metal this is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors a cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more <UNK> to infrared light a hot mirror is the opposite the coating preferentially reflects infrared mirror surfaces are sometimes given thin film <UNK> both to <UNK> degradation of the surface and to increase their <UNK> in parts of the spectrum where they will be used for instance aluminum mirrors are commonly coated with magnesium fluoride the <UNK> as a function of wavelength depends on both the thickness of the coating and on how it is applied for scientific optical work dielectric mirrors are often used these are glass or sometimes other material substrates on which one or more layers of dielectric material are deposited to form an optical coating by careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified the best mirrors of this type can reflect nine nine nine nine nine of the light in a narrow range of wavelengths which is incident on the mirror such mirrors are often used in lasers in astronomy adaptive optics is a technique to measure variable image distortions and adapt a mirror accordingly on a timescale of milliseconds to compensate for the distortions safety and easier viewing rear view mirror are applied in and on vehicles such as cars or bicycles to allow drivers to see other vehicles

book based on it see manufacturing consent noam chomsky and the media manufacturing consent the political economy of the mass media is a book by edward s herman and noam chomsky first published in one nine eight eight presenting a theory its authors call the propaganda model the book argues that since mass media news outlets are now run by large corporations they are under the same competitive pressures as other corporations according to the book the pressure to create a stable profitable business invariably distorts the kinds of news items reported as well as the manner and emphasis in which they are reported this occurs not as a result of conscious design but simply as a consequence of market selection those businesses who happen to favor profits over news quality survive while those that present a more accurate picture of the world tend to become marginalized the book further points out issues with the dependency of mass media news outlets upon major sources of news particularly the government if a particular outlet is in disfavor with a government it can be subtly shut out and other outlets given preferential treatment since this results in a loss in news leadership it can also result in a loss of readership viewership that can itself result in a loss of advertising revenue which is the primary income for most mass media newspapers magazines television to minimize the possibilities of lost revenue therefore outlets will tend to report news in a tone more favorable to the government and giving unfavorable news about the government less emphasis the

customary international law the state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications a a permanent population b a defined territory c government and d capacity to enter into relations with the other states furthermore the first sentence of article three explicitly states that the political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states this is known as the declarative theory of statehood some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient as they allow less recognized entities like the republic of china or even entirely non recognized entities like the principality of sealand to claim full status as states according to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by

sun <UNK> anime series though designs vary widely in both eastern and western mecha there is a general difference in style japanese ones tend to be anthropomorphic as opposed to more vehicular western ones and it is not unusual for japanese mecha to perform difficult acrobatic maneuvers while some western machines would have trouble getting up fingered hands are much more common on eastern mecha western designs often just have upper limbs with permanent weapon <UNK> these observances are hardly a rule though the comparison probably comes up due to the humanoid <UNK> being the most iconic of

used to describe such vehicles considerably more often in western entertainment than in asian entertainment <UNK> as a term originated from <UNK> where it is often written as <UNK> short for <UNK> or

tie ins with toy manufacturers the gundam franchise is an excellent example gundam toys and model kits produced by the japanese <UNK> bandai are ubiquitous in japan in this genre teenage pilots are more common than would be feasible in real life mecha anime and manga differ vastly in storytelling and animation quality from title to title and content ranges all the way from children s shows to ones intended for an older teen or adult audience some mecha are capable of transformation <UNK> to name but one or combining to form even bigger ones see <UNK> go <UNK> is also often credited with inventing this in one nine seven four with the television series <UNK> robo history the genre started with <UNK> <UNK> s one nine five six manga <UNK> two eight go which was later animated in one nine six three and also released abroad as <UNK> its inclusion is debatable however as the robot was controlled by remote instead of a cockpit in the machine not long after that the genre was largely defined by author go <UNK> into something considerably more fantastical <UNK> z his most famous creation was not only the first successful super robot anime series but also the pioneer of the genre staples like weapons that were activated by the hero calling out their names rocket punch it was also a pioneer in die cast metal toys such as the <UNK> series in japan and the shogun warriors in the

in similar mecha shows an ms zero six f <UNK> ii from mobile suit gundam this <UNK> ii has an additional non standard handheld shield in its left hand the appearance of gundam in one nine seven nine is considered to have broken the mecha genre into two subsets the super robot show which focused on <UNK> mecha that often had elements of mysticism and tend to use a monster of the week format and the real robot show in which the mecha are shown as tools rather than semi mystical creations and the focus is less on the machines and more on the pilots the introduction of mobile suit gundam in one

completely unique was <UNK> anno s neon genesis evangelion considered by many to be the spiritual successor to space runaway <UNK> evangelion was highly successful and quite controversial similar to its would be predecessor the mecha genre in anime is still alive and well as the new millennium came with revival <UNK> like <UNK> robo the last day and <UNK> from the super robot tradition the new gundam seed series from the real robot side and <UNK> a successful sci fi anime series in the vein of evangelion games because of their size and power and the resultant potential for massive property

plural forms respectively can refer to american mechanical design such as <UNK> though many of that game s early graphical designs were actually japanese in origin however it is not grammatically incorrect to refer to all such machines as <UNK> <UNK> is rare word origins and usage in japanese the word mecha or <UNK> is an abbreviation of 
the english mechanical and used to refer to all mechanical objects real world or fictional in this sense it is extended to humanoid human sized robots and such things as the boomers from bubblegum crisis the similar replicants of blade runner and cyborgs can be referred to as mecha as well as mundane real life objects such as industrial robots cars and even <UNK> in japanese the term giant robots is used in the similar context that english speakers have <UNK> the term mecha this is far less frequent among english speakers there are exceptions in the film a i artificial intelligence the word is used to describe <UNK> robotic humanoids as opposed to <UNK> for <UNK> humans mecha as practical war machines the question of whether mecha could ever be used in the real world as practical war machines is a widely debated topic on many mecha forums usually among mecha enthusiasts vs <UNK> due to their intended purpose mecha are usually compared to tanks or in gundam or <UNK> s case fighters mecha as a replacement for tanks the major advantage usually cited promoting mecha over tanks is the mecha s use of legs which emulates a human s ability to traverse almost any kind of terrain thus giving a mecha superior all terrain capability however the use of legs means that all of the machine s weight is focused on two relatively small points considering that most mecha are depicted as very large and heavy this could cause severe problems if the mecha were to traverse any kind of soft terrain where its legs could sink into the ground and inhibit movement this is in contrast to a tank s <UNK> which spread its weight out over a much larger area reducing the weight burden on any given point in addition the tank s <UNK> emulate the method a <UNK> uses to move which gives it excellent all terrain movement however <UNK> do have their limitations when it comes to all terrain movement numerous medium sized objects like dragon s teeth or czech <UNK> can severely limit or even stop a tank s ability to move such an obstacle might not be an issue for a bipedal <UNK> with legs also often pointed out is the agility of a mecha which can in theory move in an unpredictable manner to present a more difficult target and or dodge incoming fire in the context of two one st century projectile weapons <UNK> such attacks would be just as absurd as any human being able to do so however it would be possible for <UNK> to reduce their <UNK> through agility in order to accomplish this a mecha would need to have a range of motion very similar to a human being this range of motion precludes the battlefield use of the vast majority of mecha depictions which tend to be limited in range of movement like <UNK> <UNK> or which have mechanical control systems that limit the range of movement by limiting the range of controls linear top speed is another restriction upon <UNK> as they would be limited both in how quickly their legs could cycle while running and by the amount of stress the legs could take from impacts on the ground while doing so to say nothing of how the ground would react this restriction could be mitigated by the use of an alternate mode of travel but the frequent depiction of flying as this secondary mode would likely turn a battlefield into a trap shoot for opposing units another solution would be the use of a secondary means of locomotion in addition to walking such as feet mounted wheels or <UNK> as seen in front mission and ghost in the shell stand alone complex or the sms or secondary movement system of heavy gear another advantage stressed is the higher clearance a mecha has compared to the relatively low profile tank its higher vantage point allows it to see farther into the horizon shoot farther and at better angles however this is also a disadvantage as a mecha presents a much larger target profile as a result of its stance raising a <UNK> s clearance increases its frontal projection area making it a very obvious and easy to hit target the stance of a mecha also means that the use of armour for protection by deflection would not be of use as armour plates are more likely to be square on to incoming fire from the ground oddly the opposite could be said to be true of incoming fire from the air <UNK> also point out that a <UNK> s leg drive system would be far too complex and costly to be practical on the battlefield simply destroying a leg in combat a relatively easy thing to do considering its size compared to a tank s tread would also render the mecha immobile and out of action this is in contrast to a tank s tread system which is easy to repair and replace should the need arise another criticism involves a mecha s inherently poor stability a tank is very low and close to the ground which not only makes it harder to hit but makes it very stable a mecha is tall and can easily fall down making it extremely vulnerable if not completely useless because of this recoil becomes a serious factor when mounting high caliber weapons on a <UNK> the m one abrams tank mounts a m two five six one two zero mm gun which produces considerable recoil such a weapon mounted on the chassis of a <UNK> could possibly knock it down this limits the potential arsenal a <UNK> can carry which is in stark contrast to mecha depicted in fiction where their <UNK> are usually more varied and powerful than their tank counterparts some argue that the speedy and varied <UNK> of a <UNK> s posture can be the key to let a mecha to use even 
more powerful weapons than a tank depending on how weapons on a mecha are mounted the <UNK> could dynamically adapt leg and body posture and body weight distribution to absorb the recoil energy progressively and dynamically ie laying down prone or <UNK> the recoil with a wide stance however this solution means the mecha typically can not move while <UNK> for recoil unlike a tank which can shoot and move at the same time an extremely important tactical advantage the biggest advantage the current main battle tanks such as the m one abrams have is that they would require far fewer logistical requirements mecha as aerospace combat vehicles another use for mecha as opposed to replacing tanks would be for them to function in a similar manner to aerospace or conventional fighters as is depicted in various gundam shows or <UNK> the notion of a flying robot is sometimes considered absurd until mecha enthusiasts point out the mecha s ability to take advantage of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through a mecha s use of it s arms and legs known as <UNK> in the gundam uc universe however the ability to properly debate how such a machine would function in the real world is currently impossible due to an inability to test it mecha enthusiasts argue that <UNK> a derivative of <UNK> is a very similar real world application of humanoid <UNK> in mid air using their arms and legs <UNK> are able to have full control over the three flying axes roll pitch and yaw while planes are able to do this it s possible that the movable arms and legs of a <UNK> might be able to perform the <UNK> faster this is ideal for close ranged air combat where the positioning of forward arc of the machine could mean victory or defeat this idea of <UNK> <UNK> is also useful in space combat where there is no air for an aerodynamic plane to use flaps for <UNK> in such an environment changing facing is only possible through thrust <UNK> or <UNK> despite that some point out that even if <UNK> were to work its concept would be better utilized in non mecha designs in addition these advantages are mostly useful at close range which is rare in modern air combat while it s possible to make a fighter or mecha very fast and <UNK> it s easier to make a missile even faster and more <UNK> <UNK> also argue that creating an atmospheric flying robot is impossible in the first place mecha would have to possess fictional technology that allows continuous lift without wings or rotors which makes debating the points previously mentioned completely irrelevant other proposed uses for mecha a gear from heavy gear is a good example of small mecha bordering on powered armor it is also speculated that rather than replacing tanks a <UNK> could be used for urban combat scenarios in an infantry support role such a mecha would probably only be five seven meters tall and would be <UNK> on power armor the size of such a mecha would enable it to carry heavy weapons such as a <UNK> that would otherwise be <UNK> to an infantry squad yet its legs would allow it to <UNK> more freely than a tank in the close confines of an urban environment furthermore the presence of actuated arms would allow a mecha to deal with infantry that manage to get into direct physical contact with the <UNK> something that tanks are currently unable to do in addition it would grant several enhanced <UNK> attributes unavailable to vehicles and improved over infantry capabilities the paved roads of an urban environment would also negate the problems of weight distribution despite this a mecha in an urban environment faces the difficulty of <UNK> the sheer amount of clutter that can be present in urban terrain might prove too much for a <UNK> <UNK> to handle and also due to its much smaller size an urban combat mecha could be blocked by tank traps and other kinds of <UNK> another consideration for military use of mecha would be for non combat support functions the example in the movie aliens is one such depiction where the vaguely humanoid shape allows for an unmatched versatility in manual labour tasks under these circumstances where development of such a mecha was undertaken for other reasons it might be worthwhile for a military service to arm them after the fact all of the above issues would be mitigated by the fact that combat would not be the mecha s primary role but would instead be a secondary function only used when circumstances were dire this would naturally point us towards the development of mecha for purposes other than military heavy police action industrial <UNK> mining etc if this were to take place no doubt some military service would apply the concept of <UNK> to a fighting force were some other sector to take the cost of development upon themselves in light of all these disadvantages many consider the price of even developing a working prototype would be far too costly for something not even practical today specific mecha in media list is not comprehensive <UNK>

meaning large or wide is also applied to macroeconomics and macroscopic or macro lenses macro meaning a kind of close up photography is found at macro photography for the ancient roman policeman see <UNK> <UNK> macro a macro in computer science is an abstraction whereby a certain textual pattern is replaced according to a defined set of rules the interpreter or compiler automatically replaces the pattern when it is encountered in compiled languages macro expansion always happens at compile time the tool which performs the expansion is sometimes called a macro expander the term macro is used in many similar contexts which are derived from the concept of macro expansion including keyboard macros and macro languages in most situations the use of the word macro implies expanding a small command or action into a larger set of instructions the purpose of macros is to either automate frequently used sequences or enable a more powerful abstraction but these are often the same thing languages such as c and assembly language have simple macro systems implemented as <UNK> to the compiler or assembler c preprocessor macros work by simple textual search and replace more elaborate macros are available to c programmers by using an additional text processing language such as m four lisp languages such as common lisp and scheme have more elaborate macro systems in lisp macros behave like functions 
transforming the program text itself with the full language available to express such transformations whereas a c macro may define a simple replacement of one piece of syntax with another a lisp macro can control the evaluation of sections of code being able to choose the order of evaluation see lazy evaluation and non strict functions enables the creation of new syntactic constructs e g control structures indistinguishable from those built into the language for instance in a lisp dialect that has cond but lacks if it is possible to define the latter in terms of the former using macros entire major extensions to lisp syntax such as the clos system for object oriented programming have been defined as macros <UNK> has typed syntax macros and one productive way to think of these syntax macros is as a multi stage computation programming macros when programming macros in an unfamiliar macro language it may be helpful to record a macro to do what the user wants it to do and then open the macro file and try to gain an understanding of how the command structure works it is then possible to modify the commands to fine tune it some macro languages such as great plains accounting software s dexterity runtime engine lack the ability to import data from another data source such as a comma delimited text file this limitation can be overcome by creating a computer program in a more powerful programming language such as <UNK> to generate a specialized macro in the weaker programming language for instance a microsoft excel macro can be programmed to read data from a spreadsheet or text file and create a great plains mac file designed to enter that specific data into great plains a new mac file would be needed to be generated for each new set of data keyboard macros keyboard macros and editor macros are used interactively on a graphical user interface and text editor respectively these allow short sequences of <UNK> to substitute long sequences of commands and can provide a simple form of automation for repetitive tasks macro languages a macro language is a programming language in which all or most computation is done by expanding macros macro languages are not widely used for general purpose programming but are common in text processing applications examples c preprocessor internet macros <UNK> m four mentioned previously originally from at t bundled with unix

one five two zero from the university of sydney library the <UNK> <UNK> the hammer of witches or the <UNK> is considered by many to be the classic roman catholic text on witchcraft although it was in fact condemned by the inquisition in one four nine zero and never officially used by the catholic church first published in one four eight seven the book is notorious for its use in the <UNK> craze of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries it was compiled by two dominican inquisitors jacob <UNK> and heinrich kramer they submitted the book to the university of cologne s faculty of theology on may nine one four eight seven hoping for its endorsement this is usually taken as the date of publication although earlier editions may have been produced in one four eight five or one four eight six it was published in a number of editions thirteen times from one four eight seven to one five two zero and sixteen times from one five seven four to the lyon edition of one six six nine the book was popular throughout western and central europe although less so in england and the netherlands and was accepted by both catholics and protestants through the renaissance and the entire time that witchcraft hysteria reigned it was the most influential guide for popular <UNK> <UNK> summers called it one of the most important <UNK> and <UNK> books in the world during its time it was second only to the bible in sales until john bunyan s pilgrim s progress was published in one six seven eight and exceeded it the work was originally prefaced by the papal bull <UNK> <UNK> issued by pope innocent viii on december five one four eight four the main papal document on witchcraft it mentions <UNK> and kramer by name as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and directs them 
to combat witchcraft in northern germany the book itself was not specifically ordered by the roman catholic church the writers attached a letter of <UNK> from the university of cologne ostensibly signed by four teachers there however this letter was a forgery the university had not approved the book and had in fact condemned it for the use of unethical legal procedures and because its demonology was not consistent with catholic doctrine kramer was condemned by the inquisition in one four nine zero but the book continued in publication <UNK> by the growing popular hunger for remedies against witchcraft modern translations of the works include a two zero zero zero german translation by the professors <UNK> and <UNK> titled der <UNK> the one nine zero six translation by schmidt is considered very poor and an english translation with introduction by <UNK> summers in one nine two eight which was reprinted in one nine four eight and is still available today as a one nine seven one reprint by dover publications isbn zero four eight six two two eight zero two nine the book is divided into three sections the first proving that witchcraft or sorcery existed the second describing the forms of witchcraft and the third the detection trial and destruction of witches there is little original material in the book it is mainly a codification of existing beliefs and practices with substantial parts taken from earlier works such as nicolau <UNK> s <UNK> <UNK> one three seven six or johannes <UNK> s <UNK> one four three five the book begins with a discussion of the nature of witchcraft part of this section explains why women by their weaker nature and inferior intellect were supposedly naturally more prone to the lure of satan the book title itself has <UNK> the female noun and the writers incorrectly declare that the word <UNK> woman is a derivation of fe minus faithless the work declares that some things confessed by witches such as animal transformations were mere delusions induced by the devil to <UNK> them while other acts such as flight causing storms and destroying crops were real the book dwells at length on the <UNK> acts of witches their ability to create impotence in men and even gives space to the question of whether demons could father children of witches the writing style is serious and utterly <UNK> the last section deals with the practical details of the detection trial and destruction of witches it covers how much belief to place in witnesses testimonies and the need to eliminate malicious accusations but also states that public rumour is sufficient to bring a person to trial and that a too vigorous defence is evidence that the defender is <UNK> there are rules on how to prevent the authorities becoming <UNK> and the <UNK> that as representatives of god investigators are shielded from all of the witch s powers it covers details of how to elicit confessions including the sequence of torture and questioning to be

marks in all of her subjects with a final score of one three seven out of one five zero after that she attended <UNK> instituto <UNK> leonardo da vinci from one eight eight six to one eight nine zero kramer one nine seven six there she studied modern languages and natural sciences of all of her classes her favorite was math by the time she was ready to graduate she had decided she wanted to go into the biological sciences her family mostly her father was shocked and <UNK> it was considered impossible for a woman to be accepted into a medical school her father actually stopped just short of forbidding her to study medicine the following concerning maria s attempts to study are recorded in kramer s biography of maria <UNK> and also available through the internet sites listed in the references she checked first with the university of rome and spoke with guido <UNK> not surprising however they did not admit women into the medical program she decided instead to enroll at the university of rome to study physics mathematics and natural sciences while other students were reading novels dreaming of romance and husbands she was studying as much as possible in one eight nine two she passed her exams with an eight out of ten and received a diploma di <UNK> that made her eligible to study medicine the problem of course was she was a woman there is not much recorded on how she did it but she persisted until she was accepted into the school in kramer it was mentioned that pope leo xiii helped her somehow one nine seven six it was incredibly shocking that a woman was accepted into the school during this time period it was also considered odd to find a woman working side by side with men looking at a patient or studying the human body during the time she was at school she lived at home and had very little campus life experience however gradually other students began to accept her her and her father did not talk a lot because he was still upset about her studying medicine her mother continued to support her and sometimes helped her study in one eight nine six she had to present her thesis to a board of ten men they were highly impressed with her work and granted her the degree of doctor of medicine this made her the first woman to graduate from medical school in italy not only did she graduate but with a very impressive record at this time

rome maria also found time for other interests such as cooking and <UNK> in one eight nine seven she joined the staff at the university of rome as a voluntary assistant one of her responsibilities is what led her to her most loved occupation she was to visit <UNK> for the insane here she came across <UNK> children unable to function in schools or families and had no other public provisions she saw that they were starving for experience and started to think about what she could do to help out so in one nine zero one she returned to university with a desire to study the mind instead of the body maria <UNK> a brief biography so in one nine zero four she was offered a job teaching as the professor of anthropology at the university of rome she accepted but in one nine zero six gave the 
job up to work with sixty young children of working families this is were she developed all of her educational methods which became so successful that even learning disabled children began to pass examinations for normal children her methods will be discussed later in the paper with these sixty children she started a children s house in san lorenzo rome maria <UNK> a brief biography this children s home was an environment that was offered to the child so he may be given an opportunity to develop his activities kramer one nine seven six of course it was very dependent on financial resources and opportunities in the environment she began to notice how the children would absorb knowledge almost <UNK> from their surroundings she felt the children were teaching themselves which helped inspire her lifelong pursuit of educational reform in one nine one three she made her first visit to the united states it was during this year that alexander graham bell and his wife mabel

mayo since the thirteenth century like many who came to ireland with the norman invasion it was said of the <UNK> that they ended up more irish than the irish themselves her family had links with many diverse political strands in ireland one ancestor was a leading activist in the mayo land league and the irish republican brotherhood an uncle sir paget john <UNK> was knighted by queen elizabeth ii after a career as a judge in the colonial service while another relative was a catholic nun some branches of the family were members of the anglican church of ireland while others were roman catholics robinson was therefore born into a family that was a historical mix of rebels against and servants of the crown though catholic mary <UNK> received the permission of the then archbishop of dublin john charles <UNK> dd to study in trinity college dublin at the time catholics were forbidden by church rules from studying in trinity founded by queen elizabeth i and once a protestant unionist bastion unless they had the rarely granted permission of a bishop in her twenties she was appointed reid professor of law in the college considered to be a prestigious appointment made to accomplished lawyers subsequent holders of the title have included her successor as irish president mary <UNK> irish human rights commissioner and anti abortion campaigner professor william <UNK> and the current holder of the position abortion rights campaigner <UNK> <UNK> in one nine seven zero she married nicholas robinson despite the fact that her family had close links to the church of ireland her marriage to a

catholics career in the senate the <UNK> <UNK> robinson served in the upper house for twenty years from one nine six nine to one nine eight nine robinson s early political career included election to dublin city council in one nine seven nine where she served until one nine eight three however she first hit national headlines as one of trinity college s three members of <UNK> ireann the irish senate to which she was first elected as an independent candidate in one nine six nine from this body she campaigned on a wide range of liberal issues including the right of women to sit on juries the then requirement that all women upon marriage resign from the civil service and for the right to the legal availability of contraception this latter campaign won her many enemies condoms and other items were regularly sent in the post to the senator by conservative critics and a false rumour was spread that a chain of <UNK> that had the name robinson in the title was owned by her family and so therefore that her promotion of contraception was an attempt to benefit members of her family so unpopular was her campaign among fellow politicians that when she introduced the first bill proposing to <UNK> the law on contraception into the senate no other member would agree to second the initiative and so it could not be further discussed as a senator she served on the following parliamentary committees joint committee on ec secondary legislation one nine seven three eight nine chairman of its social affairs sub committee one nine seven seven eight seven chairman of its legal affairs committee one nine eight seven eight nine joint committee on marital breakdown one nine eight three one nine eight five for many years robinson also worked as legal advisor for the campaign for homosexual law reform with future trinity college senator david norris coincidentally just as mary <UNK> replaced mary robinson as reid professor of law in trinity and would succeed her to the irish presidency so robinson replaced <UNK> in the campaign for 
homosexual law reform one of the civic offices nicknamed the bunkers dublin corporation controversially built them on what had been one of the world s best preserved viking sites at wood quay robinson gave legal support to the leaders of the unsuccessful campaign to save the site robinson initially served in the irish upper house as an independent senator but in the mid one nine seven zero s she joined the labour party subsequently she attempted to be elected to d il ireann the lower house but her efforts were unsuccessful as were her efforts to be elected to dublin corporation robinson along with hundreds of thousands of other irish people clashed with dublin corporation when it planned to built its new administrative headquarters on wood quay one of europe s best preserved viking sites though robinson and people who in the past might not have espoused her causes fought a determined battle wood quay was ultimately <UNK> and <UNK> over to build the controversial civic offices in one nine eight two the labour party entered into a coalition government with fine gael when peter sutherland was appointed the republic of ireland s european commissioner labour demanded the choice of the next attorney general many expected robinson to be the choice but the party leader instead picked an unknown new senior counsel called john rogers shortly afterwards robinson resigned from the party in protest at the anglo irish agreement that the coalition under garret fitzgerald had signed with the british government of margaret thatcher robinson argued that unionist politicians in northern ireland should have been consulted as part of the deal despite their reluctance to share power robinson remained in the <UNK> for four more years although at this point many of the issues she had campaigned for had been tackled contraception had been <UNK> although heavily restricted women were on juries and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked to the surprise of many she decided not to seek re election to the senate in one nine eight nine one year later however labour approached her about the irish presidency for which an election was to be held she thought she was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader dick spring was proposing however as she read the briefing notes she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her after some consideration she agreed to become the first labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since one nine four five presidential candidacy beating noel browne for the nomination trinity college <UNK> served as reid professor of law in the university as well as being one of its three elected senators in <UNK> ireann for twenty years few even in the labour party gave robinson much chance of winning the presidency not least because of an internal party row over her nomination senior partisans of the political left had championed the cause of an elderly former minister and hero to the left dr noel browne for his opponents on the left browne was a brilliant but erratic maverick who had throughout his career fallen out with most of his colleagues effectively once brought down a government and been thrown out of a succession of political parties even ones he had himself founded from <UNK> na <UNK> to fianna f il labour and the socialist labour party while browne was regarded by many as <UNK> robinson proved a success months before her rivals had even been chosen she toured the country creating a favourable impression with a well thought out concept of how the office of president might be <UNK> candidates from other parties robinson s campaign was boosted by a lack of organisation in the main opposition party fine gael fine gael having <UNK> that former taoiseach garret fitzgerald would run as its candidate even though he had insisted for two years that he would not run for office then approached another senior figure peter barry who had previously been willing to run but had run out of patience and was no longer interested the party ultimately nominated the former civil rights campaigner austin currie a respected new td mp and former minister in brian faulkner s power sharing executive in northern ireland from one nine seven three one nine seven four currie had little experience in the politics of the republic and was widely seen as the party s last choice nominated only when no one else was available fianna f il chose t <UNK> and minister for defence brian <UNK> <UNK> was popular and widely seen as humorous and intelligent like robinson he had himself delivered liberal policy reform abolished censorship in the one nine six zero s for example and he was seen as a near certainty to win the presidency the only question asked was whether robinson would beat currie and come second however as the campaign proceeded it became apparent that <UNK> s victory was by no means a <UNK> conclusion and that robinson was a serious contender crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then taoiseach charles j haughey and the rising popularity of the labour party leader dick spring notwithstanding fianna f il knew they could count on <UNK> to mount a <UNK> campaign in the last few weeks <UNK> campaign <UNK> brian <UNK> s main rival for the presidency however <UNK> s credibility was shaky and it emerged during the campaign that what he told friends and insiders in private <UNK> contradicted his public statements on a controversial effort in one nine eight two by the then opposition fianna f il to pressure outgoing president <UNK> into refusing a parliamentary dissolution to then taoiseach garret fitzgerald <UNK> had <UNK> rejected the pressure president <UNK> that he had stood up to political pressure from fianna f il in one nine 
eight two won him considerable praise <UNK> denied he had pressured the president but then a tape was produced of an on the record interview he had given to a postgraduate student the previous may in which he frankly discussed attempting to apply pressure <UNK> claimed that on mature recollection he hadn t pressured the president and had been confused in his interview with the student but the government threatened to fall over the issue within days the <UNK> candidate was dismissed as t <UNK> and minister for defence though he recovered in the polls towards the end of the campaign <UNK> became the first fianna f il presidential candidate in the history of the office to lose a presidential election at this point a cabinet colleague <UNK> flynn launched a controversial personal attack on mary robinson as a wife and mother an attack that was itself attacked in response as disgraceful on live radio by michael mcdowell a senior member of the progressive democrats then in coalition with fianna f il and up to that point supporting <UNK> s campaign when robinson met mcdowell later in a restaurant she quipped with enemies like mcdowell who needs friends flynn s attack was a fatal blow to <UNK> s campaign causing many female supporters of <UNK> to vote for robinson in a gesture of support robinson became the first labour candidate the first woman and the first non fianna f il candidate in the history of contested presidential elections to win the presidency famously rt broadcast her victory speech live rather than the angelus presidency robinson was inaugurated as the seventh president of ireland on december three one nine nine zero she proved a remarkably popular president earning the praise of <UNK> himself who before his death five years later said that she was a better president than he ever could have been she took on an office that had a low profile but which once the pressures placed on president <UNK> back in one nine eight two became known suddenly was taken very seriously again as was <UNK> who was seen as a national hero because of his evident integrity in standing up to former colleagues in one nine eight two she brought to the presidency legal knowledge deep intellect and political experience her clear vision enabled her to raise issues in a manner which did not break the tight constraints of a very limited office she took on the issue of what she called the diaspora the vast number of irish emigrants and people of irish descent she also changed the face of anglo irish relations visiting britain and in one particular epoch making moment became the first irish president to visit queen elizabeth ii at buckingham palace she welcomed visits by senior british royals most notably the prince of wales to her residence ras an <UNK> in mary robinson resigns as president of ireland september one nine nine seven from left to right pat <UNK> since leader of the labour party former taoiseach john bruton t <UNK> mary <UNK> nick robinson husband president robinson taoiseach bertie ahern then labour leader <UNK> quinn and three members of the collective vice presidency the presidential commission <UNK> senator liam cosgrave chief justice liam hamilton and <UNK> <UNK> seamus patterson her political profile changed also charles j haughey taoiseach when she was elected and who had had to dismiss her rival brian <UNK> when the progressive democrats the smaller party in government threatened to leave the government unless he was sacked had a <UNK> relationship with her at one stage preventing her from delivering the prestigious bbc <UNK> lecture haughey s successors albert reynolds fianna f il one nine nine two nine four john bruton fine gael one nine nine four nine seven and bertie ahern fianna f il one nine nine seven never hid their admiration of her work with bruton s and ahern s governments actively campaigning to get her the united nations high commissioner for human rights post when she sought it in the previous fifty two years only one address to the oireachtas parliament had taken place by eamon de valera in one nine six six on the fiftieth anniversary of the easter rising robinson delivered two such addresses though they were thought too long and intellectually obscure and not judged a success she was also invited to chair a committee to review the workings of the united nations but declined when asked to by the irish government who feared that her involvement might make it difficult for it to oppose the proposals that would result if their head of state had been chair of the review group controversially on one trip to belfast she met with the local mp gerry adams the president of sinn f in foreign minister dick spring who was leader of the labour party advised her not to meet adams whose party has links with the provisional ira however the government refused to formally advise her not to meet with him she felt it would be wrong in the absence of such formal advice for her as head of state not to meet the local member of parliament during her visit and was photographed publicly shaking his hand during her various visits to northern ireland she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues including david <UNK> of the ulster unionist party and john hume of the social democratic and labour party high commissioner for human rights robinson became the united nations high commissioner for human rights on one two september one nine nine seven resigning the presidency a few weeks early with the approval of irish political parties in order to take up the post media reports suggested that she had been <UNK> for the post by secretary general of the united nations kofi annan to assume an advocacy as opposed to administrative role in other words to become a public campaigner outlining principles rather than the previous <UNK> and consensus building 
model the belief was that the post had ceased to be seen as the voice of general principles and had become largely bureaucratic robinson s role was to set the human rights agenda within the organisation and internationally <UNK> its appeal in november one nine nine seven she delivered the <UNK> lecture in oxford on the topic of realizing human rights she spoke of the daunting challenge ahead of her and how she intended to set about her task she concluded the lecture with words from the golden bough if fate has called you the bough will come easily and of its own accord otherwise no matter how much strength you muster you never will manage to quell it or cut it down with the toughest of blades in one nine nine eight she became the first commissioner to visit tibet during her tenure she criticised the irish system of permits for non eu immigrants as similar to bonded labour and criticised the united states use of the death penalty though she initially announced her intention of serving just one period in the post after an appeal from annan she extended her original term of office by one year popularity she invited groups not normally invited to presidential residences to visit her in ras an <UNK> in from the christian brothers a large religious order who ran schools throughout ireland but had never had its leaders invited to the ras to g l e n the gay and lesbian equality network she visited irish nuns and priests abroad irish famine relief charities attended international sports events met the pope where she was condemned by a young right wing priest in the irish times for supposedly breaking vatican dress codes on her visit the vatican insisted she hadn t an analysis echoed by ireland s roman catholic bishops who disowned the controversial priest s comments and to the fury of the people s republic of china met tenzin gyatso the one four th dalai lama she famously put a special symbolic light in her kitchen window in ras an <UNK> in which was visible to the public as it overlooked the principal public view of the building as a sign of remembering irish emigrants around the world placing a light in a darkened window to guide the way of strangers was an old irish folk custom robinson s symbolic light became an acclaimed symbol of an ireland thinking about its sons and daughters around the world famously she visited rwanda where she brought world attention to the suffering in that state in the aftermath of its civil war after her visit she spoke at a press conference where she became visibly emotional as a lawyer trained to be rational she was furious at her emotion but it moved everyone who saw it one media critic who had slated her presidential ideas in one nine nine zero journalist and sunday tribune editor vincent browne passed her a note at the end of the press conference saying simply you were magnificent mary robinson on the former lord lieutenant of ireland s throne signs her declaration of office using de valera s quill browne s comments matched the attitudes of irish people on robinson s achievements as president between one nine nine zero and one nine nine seven by half way through her term of office her popularity rating reached an unheard of nine three when in one nine nine seven she resigned from the presidency three months early to take up the post of united nations high commissioner for human rights she was the most widely recognised president since de valera the most popular president of ireland in the history of the office so popular she was the first choice for re election to the office if she had sought it even of the late brian <UNK> s fianna f il in the final <UNK> of her presidency former <UNK> and senior government figures stood beside her <UNK> with pride at what had

is a form of theatre combining music songs dance and spoken dialogue it is closely related to opera frequently being distinguished by the use of popular music of various forms and thus usually different instrumentation the use of unaccompanied dialogue though some musicals are entirely accompanied such as les mis <UNK> and some operas have spoken dialogue such as carmen and the avoidance of many operatic conventions introduction there are three written components of a musical the music the lyrics and the book the book of a musical refers to the spoken not sung lines in the play however book can also refer to the overall dramatic arc of a show the music and lyrics together form the score of the musical the lyrics and book together are often printed as the libretto many familiar musical theatre works have been the basis for successful musical films or were adapted for television presentations while some popular television programs have set one single episode in the style of a musical as a play on their usual format examples include episodes of ally mcbeal buffy the vampire slayer s episode once more with feeling oz s variety or space ghost coast to coast s o coast to coast or have suddenly begun singing and dancing in a musical theatre style during an episode such as in several episodes of the simpsons south park and family guy the television series cop rock which extensively used the musical format was not a success while musical theatre works are performed around the world they are most frequently produced on broadway in new york and in the west end in london a musical can be anywhere from a few minutes to several hours long however most musicals range from two hours to two hours and forty five minutes musicals today are typically presented with one <UNK> ten to fifteen minutes in length the first act is almost always somewhat longer than the second act a musical will usually have around twenty to thirty songs of varying lengths including <UNK> and <UNK> interspersed with book dialogue scenes some musicals however are sung through and do not have any spoken dialogue this can blur the line between musical theatre and opera a musical s moments of greatest dramatic intensity are often performed in song <UNK> when the emotion becomes too strong for speech you sing when it becomes 
too strong for song you dance a song must be crafted to suit the character or characters and their situation within the story a show usually opens with a song that sets the tone of the musical introduces some or all of the major characters and shows the setting of the play within the compressed nature of the musical the writers must develop the characters and the plot music provides an excellent way to express emotion however on average fewer words are sung in a five minute song than are spoken in a five minute block of dialogue therefore there is less time to develop drama than in a straight play of equivalent length since a musical may have an hour and a half or more of music in it musical collaboration musical theatre is a collaborative craft with a long history of traditional forms and structures although new writing in musicals is constantly stretching and testing the enormous flexibility of the artform taking it to previously unexplored places musicals are most commonly recognised to be a combination of sung lyric and spoken dialogue the authors there are usually several authors of a musical very few musicals are written entirely by one person a collaborative partnership of composer music lyricist lyrics and <UNK> script are generally involved although one person may serve as composer lyricist lyricist <UNK> also called librettist or <UNK> composer there can be multiple <UNK> <UNK> and or composers on any one musical there is no easy answer to the most frequently asked question about musical theatre which comes first the music or the lyric each collaboration works in a different way and tends to be unique to the specific collaborators involved sometimes a melody <UNK> a lyric sometimes a lyric <UNK> a melody however the strongest inspiration for all the authors is the driving theme of the main story of the show the initial idea for a new musical can come from the authors themselves or they might be commissioned by a producer to write a musical on a specific subject musical theatre has a long tradition of adapting plays books and other source material into this new genre history in the beginning the first theater piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical is generally considered to be the black crook with a book by charles m <UNK> and musical adaptations by giuseppe <UNK> which premiered at <UNK> s gardens in new york on september one two one eight six six the production was a staggering five and a half hours long but despite its length kept <UNK> <UNK> enough to run for four seven four performances hundreds of musical comedies were staged on broadway in the one eight nine zero s and early one nine zero zero s comprising music written in new york s tin pan alley involving composers such as gus edwards john j mcnally john walter <UNK> operetta probably the best known composers of operetta were w s gilbert and arthur sullivan whose prolific output including the mikado pirates of penzance h m s <UNK> and princess ida remains popular to this day and was frequently revived by london s recently defunct two zero zero three d <UNK> carte opera company which was dedicated to presenting their work at the savoy theatre much of their legacy served as an inspiration for the likes of victor herbert babes in <UNK> one nine zero three franz <UNK> r the merry widow one nine zero seven and oskar straus the chocolate soldier one nine one zero the roaring twenties the musical developed from opera and operetta but early musicals in the roaring twenties ignored plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses big dance routines and popular songs throughout the first half of the twentieth century popular music was dominated by theater writers many shows were <UNK> with little plot typical of the times were lighthearted productions like lady be good sunny tip toes no no <UNK> oh kay and funny face their books may have been <UNK> but they produced enduring standards from george gershwin cole porter vincent <UNK> and richard rodgers and lorenz hart among others the first production to most resemble the musical as we know it today a complete integration of book and score was show boat which premiered on december two seven one nine two seven at the ziegfeld theater in new york up to this point <UNK> ziegfeld had been known for his spectacular song and dance <UNK> featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes but there was no common theme tying the various numbers together show boat with a book and lyrics adapted from edna <UNK> s novel by oscar hammerstein ii and p g wodehouse and music by jerome kern presented a new concept that was embraced by audiences immediately despite some of its startling themes <UNK> among them the original production ran a total of five seven two performances the thirties encouraged by the success of show boat creative teams began following the format of that popular hit of thee i sing one nine three one a political satire with music by george gershwin and lyrics by ira gershwin and <UNK> <UNK> was the first musical to be awarded the pulitzer prize the band wagon one nine three one with a score by arthur schwartz and howard <UNK> starred dancing partners fred astaire and his sister adele while it was primarily a revue it served as the basis for two subsequent film versions that were book musicals in the <UNK> sense porter s anything goes one nine three four affirmed ethel <UNK> s position as the first lady of musical theatre a title she maintained for many years gershwin s porgy and bess one nine three

confines of the one nine five zero s rock music would be used in several broadway musicals perhaps the most significant of which was hair which featured not only rock music but also nudity and controversial opinions about the vietnam war other important rock musicals of the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s included jesus christ superstar <UNK> and two gentlemen of verona the musical also went in other directions shows like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> brought a significant african american influence to broadway more and more different musical genres were turned into musicals either on or off broadway automotive companies and other types of corporations hired broadway talent to write corporate musicals private shows which were only seen by their employees more recent eras one nine seven six brought one of the great contemporary musicals to the stage a chorus line emerged from recorded group therapy style sessions michael bennett conducted with gypsies those who sing and dance in support of the leading players from the broadway community from hundreds of hours of tapes james kirkwood and nick dante fashioned a book about an audition for a musical incorporating into it many of the real life stories of those who had sat in on the sessions and some of whom eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show with music by marvin <UNK> and lyrics by edward <UNK> a chorus line first opened at joseph <UNK> s public theater in lower manhattan advance word of mouth that something extraordinary was about to explode boosted box office sales and after critics ran out of <UNK> to describe what they witnessed on opening night what initially had been planned as a limited engagement eventually moved to the <UNK> theater uptown for a run that seemed to last forever the show swept the tony awards and won the pulitzer prize and its hit song what i did for love became an instant standard clearly broadway audiences were eager to welcome musicals that strayed from the usual style and substance john <UNK> and fred ebb explored pre world war ii nazi germany in cabaret and prohibition era chicago which relied on old vaudeville techniques to tell its tale of murder and the media pippin by stephen schwartz was set in the days of charlemagne federico fellini s autobiographical film eight became maury <UNK> s nine but old fashioned values were embraced as well in such hits as annie four two nd street my one and only and popular revivals of no no <UNK> and irene the one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s saw the influence of european mega musicals or pop operas which typically featured a pop influenced score and had large casts and sets and were identified as much by their notable effects a falling <UNK> a helicopter landing on stage as they were by anything else in the production many were based on novels or other works of literature the most important writers of mega musicals include the french team of claude michel schoenberg and alain <UNK> responsible for les mis <UNK> and miss saigon inspired by madame butterfly and the british composer andrew lloyd webber who wrote <UNK> based on the life of argentina s eva per n cats derived from the poems of t s eliot the phantom of the opera and sunset boulevard from the classic film of the same name these decades also saw the influence of large corporations that produced musicals the most important has been disney which adapted some of their animated movie musicals such as beauty and the beast and the lion king which is said to have been responsible for the revitalization of four two nd street between broadway and eighth avenue previously a strip of tourist trap souvenir shops arcades <UNK> shows and porn theaters for the stage and also created original stage productions like aida with music by elton john les mis <UNK> the logo seen round the world the growing scale and cost of musicals led to some concern that musicals were <UNK> substance in 
favor of style the one nine nine zero s and two zero zero zero s have seen many writers create smaller musicals <UNK> passion the topics vary widely and the music ranges from <UNK> to pop but they generally are produced off broadway and feature much smaller casts and thus much lower costs there also had been the concern that the musical had lost touch with the tastes of the general public in america and that the musical was increasingly doomed to be something viewed by a smaller and smaller audience one of the most important writers who attempted to increase the popularity of musicals among a younger audience was jonathan larson whose musical rent based on the opera la <UNK> me featured a cast of <UNK> and whose score was heavily rock influenced the musical has been a smash success even with its composer dying of an aortic <UNK> on the night of the final dress rehearsal at new york theatre workshop before he could see it reach broadway other writers who have attempted to bring a taste of modern rock music to the stage include jason robert brown another trend has been to create a plot to fit a collection of songs that have already been hits thus mamma mia featuring songs by abba <UNK> out based on the tunes of billy joel good vibrations the beach boys and all shook up elvis presley familiarity may breed contempt but it s also embraced by producers anxious to guarantee they <UNK> their very considerable investments if not show a healthy profit some are willing to take chances on the new and unusual such as avenue q which utilizes puppets to tell its very adult themed story or bombay dreams about the bollywood musicals <UNK> out by indian cinema but the majority prefer to hedge their bets by sticking with the familiar revivals of family fare like wonderful town or fiddler on the roof or proven hits like la cage aux <UNK> today s composers are finding their sources in already proven material cult films like the producers or <UNK> classic literature such as little women and dracula hoping they ll have a built in audience as a result at the present time late two zero zero four the musical is being pulled in a number of different directions gone are the days when a sole producer a david <UNK> or a cameron mackintosh backs a production corporate sponsors dominate broadway and often alliances are formed to stage musicals which require an investment of one zero million or more in two zero zero two the credits for thoroughly modern <UNK> listed ten producers and among those names were entities comprised of several individuals typically off broadway and regional theaters tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals and in recent times more and more development of new musicals has taken place outside of new york wicked for example first opened in san francisco and its creative team relied on the mostly mediocre reviews to assist them in <UNK> the show before it reached broadway where it ultimately became a healthy hit as we move on into the future of musicals it would appear that the spectacle format is on the rise again returning to the times when romans would have mock sea battles on stage this is most apparent in

living near the sea coast or da silva from the forest if lived inland the surname dos santos from the saints was given to orphan children this explains why these names da costa da silva dos santos are

for the album by the cinematic orchestra see motion album in physics motion means a change in the position of a body with respect to time as measured by a particular observer in a particular frame of reference until the end of the one nine th century newton s laws of motion which 
he posited as axioms or postulates in his famous principia were the basis of what has since become known as classical physics calculations of trajectories and forces of bodies in motion based on newtonian or classical physics were very successful until physicists began to be able to measure and observe very fast physical phenomena at very high speeds the equations of classical physics were not able to calculate accurate values to address these problems the ideas of henri poincar and albert einstein concerning the fundamental phenomenon of motion were adopted in lieu of newton s whereas newton s laws of motion assumed absolute values of space and time in the equations of motion the model of einstein and poincar now called the special theory of relativity assumed values for these concepts with arbitrary zero points because for example the special relativity equations yielded accurate results at high speeds and newton s did not the special relativity model is now accepted as explaining bodies in motion when we ignore gravity however as a practical matter newton s equations are much easier to work with than those of special relativity and therefore are more often used in applied physics and engineering in the newtonian model because motion is defined as the proportion of space to time these concepts are prior to motion just as the concept of motion itself is prior to force in other words the properties of space and time determine the nature of motion and the properties of motion in turn determine the nature of force in the special relativistic model motion can be thought of as something like an angle between a space direction and the time direction in special relativity and euclidean space only relative motion can be measured and absolute motion is meaningless

see also medical malpractice educational malpractice tort law mediation consists of a process of alternative dispute resolution in which a generally neutral third party the mediator using appropriate techniques assists two or more parties to help them negotiate an agreement with concrete effects on a matter of common interest more generally speaking the term mediation covers any activity in which an impartial third party often a professional facilitates an agreement on any matter in the common interest of the parties involved mediation applies to different fields with some common peculiar elements and some differences for each of its specialties the main fields of mediation include commerce legal disputes and diplomacy but forms of mediation appear in other fields as well mediation in marriage technically belongs in the category although it has followed its own peculiar history since the times of ancient greeks compare marriage counselling history of mediation the activity of mediation in itself appeared in very ancient times historians presume early cases in phoenician commerce but suppose its use in babylon too the practice developed in ancient greece which knew the non marital mediator as a <UNK> then in roman civilization roman law starting from justinian s digest of five three zero five three three recognised mediation the romans called mediators by a variety of names including <UNK> medium <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and finally mediator the middle ages regarded mediation differently sometimes forbidding the practice or restricting its use to centralized authorities some cultures regarded the mediator as a sacred figure worthy of particular respect and the role partly overlapped with that of traditional wise men common aspects of mediation mediation as a process involves a third party often a neutral third party assisting two or more persons parties or <UNK> to find mutually agreeable solutions to difficult problems people make use of mediation at all levels and in all contexts from minor disputes to global peace talks this makes it difficult to provide a general description without referring to practices in specific jurisdictions where mediation may in fact have a formal definition and in some venues may require specific licenses this article attempts only a broad introduction with more specific processes such as peace process binding arbitration or <UNK> mediation referred to directly in the text while some people loosely use the term mediation to mean any instance in which a third party helps people find agreement professional mediators generally believe it essential that mediators have thorough training competency and continuing education some few of the types of disputes or decision making that often go to mediation include the following family <UNK> agreements financial or budget disagreements separation divorce financial distribution and <UNK> support <UNK> parenting plans child custody and visitation <UNK> issues family businesses adult sibling conflicts disputes between parents and adult children estate disputes medical ethics and end of life issues workplace wrongful termination discrimination harassment grievances labor management public disputes environmental land use disputes involving the following issues landlord tenant <UNK> associations builders contractors <UNK> <UNK> contracts of any kind medical malpractice personal injury partnerships non profit organizations faith communities other youth school conflicts peer mediation violence prevention victim offender mediation mediation commonly includes the following aspects or stages a controversy dispute or difference of positions between people or a need for decision making or problem solving decision making remaining with the parties rather than imposed by a third party the willingness of the parties to negotiate 
a positive solution to their problem and to accept a discussion about respective interests and objectives the intent to achieve a positive result through the <UNK> help of an independent neutral third person in the united states mediator codes of conduct emphasize client directed solutions rather than those imposed by a mediator in any way this has become a common definitive feature of mediation in the us and in the uk mediation differs from most other adversarial resolution processes by virtue of its simplicity <UNK> flexibility and economy the typical mediation has no formal compulsory elements although some common elements usually occur each party allowed to explain and detail his her story the identification of issues usually facilitated by the mediator the clarification and detailed specification of respective interests and objectives the conversion of respective subjective evaluations into more objective values identification of options discussion and analysis of the possible effects of various solutions the adjustment and the refining of the accessory aspects the <UNK> of agreements into a written draft due to the particular character of this activity each mediator uses a method of his or her own a mediator s methods are not ordinarily governed by law that might eventually be very different from the above scheme also many matters do not legally require a particular form for the final agreement while others expressly require a precisely determined form most countries respect a mediator s confidentiality mediation in business and in commerce the eldest branch of mediation applies to business and commerce and still this one is the widest field of application with reference to the number of mediators in these activities and to the economical range of total exchanged values the mediator in business or in commerce helps the parties to achieve the final goal of respectively buying selling a <UNK> <UNK> that includes all the possible varieties of the exchange of goods or rights something at satisfactory conditions typically in the aim of producing a <UNK> contract <UNK> bringing the separate elements of the treaty to a respectively balanced equilibrium the mediator in the ordinary practice usually cares of finding a positive agreement between or among the parties looking at the main pact as well as at the accessory <UNK> too thus finding a composition of all the related aspects that might combine in the best possible way all the <UNK> of his clients this activity is sometimes <UNK> included among those of the auxiliary activities of commerce and business but it has to be recalled that it differs from the generality of the others because of its character of independence from the parties in an ordinary activity of agency or in the unilateral mandate this character is obviously missing this kind of agent merely resulting as a <UNK> <UNK> of the party that gave him his wider or narrower power of representation the mediator does not obey to any of the parties and is a third party looking at the <UNK> from an external point of view subfields of commercial mediation include work in well known specialized branches in finance in insurance in ship <UNK> in real estate and in some other individual markets mediators have specialised designations and usually obey special laws generally mediators cannot practice commerce in the genre of goods in which they work as specialized mediators community mediation disputes involving neighbors often have no formal dispute resolution mechanism community mediation centers generally focus on this type of neighborhood conflict with trained volunteers from the local community <UNK> serving as mediators these organizations often serve populations that cannot afford to utilize the court systems or other private alternative dispute resolution providers competence of the mediator numerous schools of thought exist on identifying the competence of a mediator where parties retain mediators to provide an evaluation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the parties positions subject matter expertise of the issues in dispute becomes a primary aspect in determining competence some would argue however that an individual who gives an opinion about the merits or value of a case does not practise true mediation and that to do so fatally compromises the alleged mediator s neutrality where mediators are expected to be process experts only i e having been employed to use their skills to work through the mediation process without offering evaluations as to the parties claims competence is usually demonstrated by the ability to remain neutral and to move parties though various impasse points in a dispute international professional organizations continue to debate what competency means current information can be obtained from professional associations such as the association for conflict resolution mediation as a method of dispute resolution in the field to resolving legal controversies mediation is an informal method of dispute resolution in which a neutral third party the mediator attempts to assist the parties in finding resolution to their problem through the mediation process although mediation has no legal standing per se agreements between the parties can usually with assistance from legal counsel be committed to writing and signed thus rendering a legally binding contract in some jurisdiction specified therein mediation differs from most other conflict resolution processes by virtue of its simplicity and the clarity of its rules it is employed at all scales from petty civil disputes to global peace talks it is thus difficult to characterize it independently of these scales or specific jurisdictions where mediation may in fact be formally defined and may in fact require specific licenses there are more specific processes such as peace process or binding arbitration or <UNK> mediation referred to directly in the text safety fairness closure these broader political methods usually focus on conciliation preventing future problems rather than on focused dispute resolution of one matter mediation can be reasonably seen as the simplest of many such processes where there is no great dispute about political context jurisdiction has been agreed whatever process selected the mediator is not in doubt and there is no great fear that safety 
fairness and closure guarantees will be violated by future bad faith actions if some warranty of safety fairness and closure can be assumed then the process can reasonably be called mediation proper and be described thus process and role of the mediator in us practice generally the process consists of the following stages an introduction by the mediator that includes establishing ground rules suggested by the mediators and the parties the parties telling their stories in an uninterrupted manner the mediator s asking questions to clarify the issues the mediator s discovery of the parties underlying interests concerns related to the issues the parties generation of options that may resolve the dispute the reality testing of the options leading to one option that best resolves the issues for all parties and <UNK> of the resulting agreement in writing the mediator has the role of guiding this process people have used mediation extensively in virtually every type of conflict situation ranging from commercial and family cases to criminal matters involving juvenile and adult offenders meeting with victims to negotiate restitution mediation is increasingly ordered by judges in court cases where a collaborative approach to resolving a conflict is viewed as advantageous to the traditional adversarial process in family cases setting parties on a path of collaborative problem solving is viewed as superior to traditional approaches where children in particular are harmed by the effects of protracted litigation mediation with arbitration mediation has sometimes been utilized to good effect when coupled with arbitration particularly binding arbitration in a process called mediation arbitration in this process if parties are unable to reach resolution through mediation the mediator becomes an arbitrator shifting the mediation process into an arbitral one seeking additional evidence as needed particularly from witnesses if any since witnesses are normally not called upon by a mediator and finally rendering an arbitral decision this process is more appropriate in civil matters where rules of evidence or jurisdiction are not in dispute it resembles in some respects criminal plea bargaining and confucian judicial procedure wherein the judge also plays the role of prosecutor rendering what in western european court procedures would be considered an arbitral even arbitrary decision mediation arbitration hybrids can pose significant ethical and process problems for mediators many of the options and successes of mediation relate to the mediator s unique role as someone who <UNK> coercive power over neither the parties nor the outcome if parties in a mediation are aware the mediator might later need to act in the role of judge the process could be dramatically distorted <UNK> mediation arbitration often involves using different individuals in the role of mediator and if needed later arbitrator but this is not always the case mediator liability the role of mediator is less controversial than the role of judge if only because a mediator may only propose rather than impose a contract the assumed moral or legal responsibility or even liability of the mediator differs drastically in different methods for instance in global political negotiations it is often difficult to find anyone who is sufficiently trusted by both sides to even get a peace process to begin accordingly liability is not assigned to the mediator no matter how badly things go wrong doing so would discourage future efforts to help liability in the united states note the differences between the legal definition of civil mediation in the united states of america and mediation in other countries compared with the situation elsewhere mediation appears more <UNK> in the united states where state laws regarding the use of lawyers as opposed to mediators may differ widely one can best understand these differences in a more global context of variances between countries within the united states the laws governing mediation vary greatly on a state by state basis some states have fairly sophisticated laws concerning mediation including clear expectations for certification ethical standards and protections preserving the confidential nature of mediation by ensuring that mediators need not testify in a case they ve worked on however even in states that have such developed laws around mediation that law only relates to mediators working within the court system community and commercial mediators practising outside the court system may very well not have these same sorts of legal protections liability insurance is often an option professional mediators consider it has traditionally been marketed through professional dispute resolution organizations mediation in politics and in diplomacy mediation is typically one of the most important activities of diplomats and some people consider that it should be a relevant quality of democratic politicians given that usually in both these fields the <UNK> of the respective mansions on a formal basis at least require the achievement of agreements between separate entities of which the diplomat or the politician are third parties by definition hobbes and <UNK> found that the organs of a state have a mediating power and function these activities are usually performed in order to get on the subjective point of view of this mediator a <UNK> that might be in the form of a direct economical advantage a political advantage an increased international prestige or influence one of many non violent methods of dispute resolution in politics and in diplomacy mediation obviously offers a non violent method of dispute resolution some indeed argue that other methods would be many although it is usually assumed or included in definitions of other methods some theorists notably <UNK> kidder have claimed that mediation is the foundation of a new some say postmodern ethics and that it <UNK> traditional ethical issues with pre defined limits of morality others claim that mediation is a form of harms reduction or de escalation especially in its large scale application in peace process and similar negotiation or the bottom up way it is performed in the peace movement where it is often called <UNK> mediation in this form it would be derived from methods of quakers in particular global relevance the rise of international trade 
law continental trading blocs the world trade organization and its opposing anti globalization movement use of the internet among other factors seem to suggest that legal complexity has started to reach to an intolerable and undesirable point there may be no obvious way to determine which jurisdiction has precedence over which other and there may be substantial resistance to settling a matter in any one place accordingly mediation may come into more widespread use replacing formal legal and judicial processes <UNK> by nation states some like the anti globalization movement believe such formal processes have quite thoroughly failed to provide real safety and closure guarantees that are pre requisite to uniform rule of law following an increasing awareness of the process and a wider notion of its main aspects and eventual effects mediation is in recent times frequently proposed as a form of resolution of international disputes with attention to belligerent situations too however as mediation ordinarily needs to be required by the interested parties and it would be very difficult to impose it in case one of the parts refuses this process it cannot be a solution fairness as noted mediation can only take place in an atmosphere where there is some agreement on safety fairness and closure usually provided by nation states and their legal systems but increasingly disputes transcend those borders and include many parties who may be in unequal power relationships in such circumstances with many parties afraid to be identified or to make formal complaints terminology or rules of standing or evidence slanted against some groups and without power to enforce even legally binding contracts some conclude that the process of mediation would not reasonably be said to be fair accordingly even when it is offered and attempts are made to make it fair mediation itself might not be a fair process and other means might be pursued from a more technical point of view however one must recall that the mediation must be required by the parties and very seldom can it be imposed by non parties upon the parties therefore in presence of entities that cannot be clearly identified and that practically don t claim for their recognition as parties the professional experience of a mediator could only apply to a proposal of definition that besides would always miss the constitutional elements of a mediation moreover in such circumstances the counter party of these eventual entities would very likely deny any prestige of party to the opponent this not consenting any kind of treaty in a correct mediation more generally given that mediation ordinarily produces agreements containing elements to enforce the <UNK> with facts that can grant its effectiveness note that the legal system is not the only means that will ensure protection of the <UNK> modern mediation frequently tends to define economical <UNK> and <UNK> too generally considered quicker and more effective the concrete power of an agreement is classically found in the <UNK> of the pact in the sincere conciliation of respective interests and in the inclusion of measures that would make the rupture of the pact very little convenient for the unfaithful party <UNK> that don t have such sufficient <UNK> are only academically effects of a mediation but would never respect the <UNK> of the

felons depending on the jurisdiction examples of misdemeanors may include petty theft prostitution simple assault trespass vandalism and other similar crimes in general misdemeanors are crimes with a maximum punishment of one two months or less of incarceration typically in a local jail again as contrasted with felons who are typically incarcerated in a prison those people who are convicted of misdemeanors are often punished with probation community service or part time imprisonment served on the weekends in anglo american law misdemeanors are in the middle range of seriousness for violations of the law felonies are the most serious and typically result in automatic forfeit of some civil rights including suffrage and commonly involve lengthy incarceration typically only those charged with felonies are entitled to the right of trial by jury infractions are the least serious are punishable only by fine and a command to reverse the behavior and never carry a formal social stigma examples of violations include parking and minor traffic offences late payment of fees and building code violations misdemeanors never result in the loss of civil rights but may result in loss of privileges such as professional licences public offices or public employment this is more common when the misdemeanor is related to the privilege in question such as the loss of a taxi driver s

mathematical logic a mathematical model is an abstract model that uses mathematical language to describe the behaviour of a system mathematical models are used particularly in the natural sciences and engineering disciplines such as physics biology and electrical engineering but also in the social sciences such as economics sociology and political science physicists engineers computer scientists and economists use mathematical models most extensively examples of mathematical models population growth a simple though approximate model of population growth is the <UNK> growth model the preferred population growth model is the logistic function model of a particle in a potential field in this model we consider a particle as being a point of mass m which describes a trajectory which is modeled by a function x r r three given its coordinates in space as a function of time the potential field is given by a function v r three r and the trajectory is a solution of the differential equation m frac x t operatorname v x t note this model assumes the particle is a point mass which is certainly known to be false in many cases we use this model for example as a model of planetary motion model of rational behavior for a consumer in this model we assume a consumer faces a choice of n commodities labelled one two n each with a market price p one p two p n the consumer is assumed to have a cardinal utility function u cardinal in the sense that it assigns numerical values to utilities depending on the amounts of commodities x one x two x n consumed the model further assumes that the consumer has a budget m which she uses to purchase a vector x one x two x n in such a way as to maximize u x one x two x n the problem of rational behavior in this model then becomes one of constrained maximization that is maximize u x one x two ldots x n subject to sum n p i x i m this model has been used in models of general equilibrium theory particularly to show existence and pareto <UNK> of economic equilibria however the fact that this particular formulation assigns numerical values to levels of satisfaction is the source of criticism and even ridicule however it is not an essential ingredient of the theory and again this is an <UNK> neighbour sensing model explains the mushroom formation from the initially chaotic fungal network background often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized they use a mathematical model in analysis engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis 
of how the system could work or try to estimate how an <UNK> event could affect the system similarly in control of a system engineers can try out different control approaches in simulations a mathematical model usually describes a system by a set of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables the values of the variables can be practically anything real or integer numbers boolean values or strings for example the variables represent some properties of the system for example measured system outputs often in the form of signals timing data counters event occurrence yes no the actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables building blocks there are six basic groups of variables decision variables input variables state variables exogenous variables random variables and output variables since there can be many variables of each type the variables are generally represented by vectors decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables exogenous variables are sometimes known as parameters or constants the variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision input random and exogenous variables furthermore the output variables are dependent on the state of the system represented by the state variables objectives and constraints of the system and its users can be represented as functions of the output variables or state variables the objective functions will depend on the perspective of the model s user depending on the context an objective function is also known as an index of performance as it is some measure of interest to the user although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have using or optimizing the model becomes more involved computationally classifying mathematical models mathematical models can be classified in several ways some of which are described below linear vs nonlinear if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by linear equations then the model is known as a linear model if one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a nonlinear equation then the model is known as a nonlinear model deterministic vs probabilistic stochastic a deterministic model performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions while in a stochastic model randomness is present even when given an identical set of initial conditions static vs dynamic a static model does not account for the element of time while a dynamic model does dynamic models typically are represented with difference equations or differential equations lumped parameters vs distributed parameters if the model is homogeneous consistent state throughout the entire system the parameters are lumped if the model is heterogeneous varying state within the system then the parameters are distributed distributed parameters are typically represented with partial differential equations a priori information mathematical modelling problems are often classified into black box or white box models according to how much a priori information is available of the system a black box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available a white box model also called glass box or clear box is a system where all necessary information is available practically all systems are somewhere between the black box and white box models so this concept only works as an intuitive guide for approach usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate therefore the white box models are usually considered easier because if you have used the information correctly then the model will behave correctly often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables for example if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an exponentially decaying function but we are still left with several unknown parameters how rapidly does the medicine amount decay and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood this example is therefore not a completely white box model these parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model in black box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions using a priori information we could end up for example with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately if there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models an often used approach for black box models are neural networks which usually do not assume almost anything about the incoming data the problem with using a large set of functions to describe a system is that estimating the parameters becomes increasingly difficult when the amount of parameters and different types of functions increases complexity another basic issue is the complexity of a model if we were for example modelling the flight of an airplane we could embed each mechanical part of the airplane into our model and would thus acquire an almost white box model of the system however the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model additionally the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model it is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model for example newton s classical mechanics is an approximated model of the real world still newton s model is quite sufficient for most ordinary life situations that is as long as particle speeds are well below the speed of light and we study macro particles only training any model which is not pure white box contains 
some parameters that can be used to fit the model to the system it shall describe if the modelling is done by a neural network the optimization of parameters is called training in more conventional modelling through explicitly given mathematical functions parameters are determined by curve fitting model evaluation an important part of the modelling process is the evaluation of an acquired model how do we know if a mathematical model describes the system well this is not an easy question to answer usually the engineer has a set of measurements from the system which are used in creating the model then if the model was built well the model will adequately show the relations between system variables for the measurements at hand the question then becomes how do we know that the measurement data are a representative set of possible values does the model describe well the properties of the system between the measurement data interpolation does the model describe well events outside the measurement data extrapolation a common approach is to split the measured data into two parts training data and verification data the training data are used to train the model that is to estimate the model parameters see above the verification data are used to evaluate model performance assuming that the training data and verification data are not the same we can assume that if the model describes the verification data well then the model describes the real system well however this still leaves the extrapolation question open how well does this model describe events outside the measured data consider again newtonian classical mechanics model newton made his measurements without advanced equipment so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light likewise he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles but macro particles only it is then not surprising that his model does not <UNK> well into these domains even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics see also model simulation computer simulation biologically inspired computing model economics mathematical models in physics external

<UNK> s time of chinese literature and poetics certainly many entries of the man y sh have a continental tone earlier poems having confucian or taoist themes and later poems reflecting on buddhist

merits the man y sh is important for using one of the earliest japanese writing systems the cumbersome man y <UNK> though it wasn t the first use of this writing system which was invented for the

type ii a and b strings m theory is a cutting edge theory of physics that deals with the extension of superstring 
theory it is somewhat contentious in the physics community in the absence of experimental backup if ever experimentally verified m theory and string theory would represent remarkable advances in science string theory to understand m theory it is necessary to first get some understanding of string theory for hundreds of years physics has operated on the paradigm that the fundamental particles like the familiar electron are point like or in mathematical jargon zero dimensional if string theory were to be summed up in a single idea it is that this assumption is incorrect instead string theory posits that the universe is fundamentally composed of one dimensional objects things that are similar to a string these strings would be so small that on even the tiny scale of particles they would seem like points in string theory each fundamental particle is created in some sense by different patterns of vibration of the strings one might ask why physicists have constrained themselves to zero dimensional points for all this time the answer is that one dimensional objects are much harder to work with and often cause technical problems with causality and violations of special relativity s mandate that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light string theory s development has come primarily because of an extremely important problem that has plagued physics for almost one zero zero years the problem is that general relativity the theory developed by albert einstein that explains things on very large or cosmological scales is irreconcilable with quantum mechanics and the standard model which describe the universe on the small subatomic scale additionally there are problems with the standard model it has around two zero free parameters that must be plugged in by hand and has a large number of particles it declares fundamental there are three copies of every particle organized in what are termed as families whose only difference from one another is mass also because it can t be reconciled with general relativity it lacks a description of gravity the most familiar of the four fundamental forces it turns out that using one dimensional objects instead of point particles solves many of these problems the number of free parameters in the theory drops from two zero to one a parameter that corresponds to the size of the strings and there is hope that details of the theory will explain why the three families of particles exist most importantly string theorists were delighted to find that string theory necessarily contains gravitons the particle that causes gravity edward witten the founder of m theory jokes that string theory does have the remarkable experimental evidence that gravity exists all around us thus string theory successfully unites general relativity with quantum mechanics however there are some problems with string theory first of all it requires one zero dimensions for the strings to vibrate in as opposed to the four three space and one time dimensions that we commonly observe this may seem ludicrous it is however possible if the extra six dimensions are extremely tiny and curled up for example if you look at a tube from a great distance it seems to be just a line one dimensional closer inspection of the tube reveals two dimensions though one that is along the tube the one we saw from far away and one that is going around the tube thus the tube is really a two dimensional surface despite the fact that it appears to be a line from far away another problem with string theory is that there are five different formulations of it this is a key to understanding where m theory comes in the five theories differ in what kind of strings they allow and in how they implement <UNK> a technical part of string theory that leads to the often used name super string theory these five different theories <UNK> called type i type iia type iib so three two and e eight e eight pronounced e eight times e eight not e eight ex e eight are something of an embarrassment of riches for string theorists since string theory claims to be a theory of everything there should really only be one consistent formulation of the theory but instead there are five here is where m theory steps in to the rescue m theory in one nine nine five edward witten initiated what has been called the second superstring revolution by introducing m theory to the world this theory combines the five different string theories along with a previously abandoned attempt to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics called eleven dimensional supergravity into one theory this is accomplished by knitting together a web of relationships between each of the theories called <UNK> specifically s duality t duality and u duality each of these <UNK> provides a way of converting one of the string theories into another t duality is probably the most easily explained of the <UNK> it has to do with the size denoted by r of the curled up dimensions of the string theories it was discovered that if you take a type iia string theory that has a size r and change the radius to one r then you will end up getting what is equivalent to a type iib theory of size r this duality along with the others creates connections between all five or six if you count supergravity theories factually these <UNK> existence had been known before witten came up with the idea of m theory what witten did was to predict that the fact that all of these different theories were connected was as a result of there being some underlying theory to which they were all approximations additionally it was found that the equations that required string theory to exist in one zero dimensions were also approximations the proposed and somewhat nebulous m theory would instead be a theory that took place in one one dimensions although the details have not been pinned 
down m theory is a variation of string theory taking into account all of the five string theories and showing they are basically the same in a general sense m theory is the most current version of superstring theory that uses one one dimensions superstring theory uses between eight and two two what m stands for according to its creator ed witten as quoted in the pbs documentary based on brian greene s book the elegant universe the m in m theory stands for magic mystery or matrix according to taste books brian greene has written books explaining string theory and m theory for the layman in

is perhaps the best known of the scottish monarchs in part because of the tragedy of her life early years princess mary stuart was born at <UNK> palace <UNK> west lothian scotland on december eight one five four two to king james v of scotland and his french wife marie de guise she was the first member of the royal house of stuart to use the <UNK> spelling stuart rather than the earlier stewart during the one four th century reign of robert ii of scotland it had been confirmed that the scottish crown would only be inherited by males in the line of robert s children all sons who were listed in that parliamentary act this was done because the legitimacy of robert s children from his first marriage was questionable females and female lines could inherit only after extinction of male lines all other male lines had died out years before but the duke of albany a royal cousin had lived until one five three six had he not died before james v mary would not necessarily have inherited in this sort of semi <UNK> situation mary ascended the throne because all other male lines of the royal house had become extinct before the death of mary s father her father died at the age of thirty probably from cholera although his contemporaries believed his death to have been caused by grief over the scots humiliating loss to the english at the battle of <UNK> moss in falkland palace fife her father

of arran the next in line for the throne acting as regent until one five five four when he was succeeded by the queen s mother who continued as regent until her own death in one five six zero six months after her birth in july one five four three the treaties of greenwich promised mary to be married to edward son of king henry viii of england in one five five two and for their heirs to inherit the kingdoms of scotland and england two months later mary and her mother who strongly opposed the marriage proposition went into hiding in stirling castle where preparations were made for mary s coronation coronation the infant mary was crowned as queen of scots in the chapel royal at stirling castle on september nine one five four three due to the age of the queen and the unique ceremony the coronation 
was the talk of europe on the day of the coronation mary was dressed in heavy regal robes in miniature a crimson velvet mantle with a train <UNK> with ermine was fastened around her tiny neck and a <UNK> <UNK> gown with long hanging sleeves enveloped the infant who could sit up but not walk she was carried by lord livingston in solemn procession to the chapel royal inside lord livingston brought mary forward to the altar and put her gently in the throne set up there then he stood by holding her to keep her from rolling off quickly cardinal david beaton put the coronation oath to her which lord livingston answered for her immediately then the cardinal <UNK> her heavy robes and began anointing her with the holy oil on her back breast and the palms of her hands when the chill air struck her she began to cry the earl of lennox whose son henry lord <UNK> later became mary s two nd husband brought forward the sceptre and placed it in her baby hand and she grasped the heavy shaft then the sword of state was presented by the earl of argyll and the cardinal performed the ceremony of <UNK> the three foot sword to the tiny body then the earl of arran carried the crown holding it gently cardinal beaton lowered it onto the child s head where it rested on a <UNK> of velvet the cardinal <UNK> the crown and lord livingston held her body straight as the earls of lennox and arran kissed her cheek in fealty followed by the rest of the prelates and peers who <UNK> before her and placing their hands on her crown swore allegiance to her rough wooing the treaties of greenwich fell apart soon after mary s coronation the betrothal did not sit well with the scots especially since henry viii <UNK> tried to change the agreement so that he could possess mary years before the marriage was to take place he also wanted them to break their traditional alliance with france fearing an uprising among the people the scottish parliament broke off the treaty at the end of the year this did not sit well with henry viii however and he began his rough wooing designed to impose the marriage to his son on mary this consisted of a series of raids on scottish territory and other such actions it lasted until june one five five one costing over half a million pounds and many lives in may of one five four four the english earl of hertford later created duke of somerset by edward vi arrived in the firth of forth hoping to capture edinburgh and kidnap the infant queen but marie de guise hid her in the secret chambers of stirling castle the french remaining true to the auld alliance came to the aid of the scots on september one zero one five four seven known as black saturday the scots suffered a bitter defeat at the battle of <UNK> <UNK> marie de guise fearful for her daughter sent her temporarily to <UNK> priory and turned to the french ambassador monsieur d <UNK> the new french king henri ii was now proposing to unite france and scotland by marrying the little queen to his newborn son the dauphin francois this seemed to marie to be the only sensible solution to her troubles in february one five four eight hearing that the english were on their way back marie moved her daughter to dumbarton castle the english left a trail of devastation behind once more and seized the strategically located town of <UNK> by june the much awaited french help had arrived on july seven the french marriage treaty was signed at a nunnery near <UNK> mary would be sent to france where henri ii had offered to guard her and raise her on august seven one five four eight the french fleet sent by henri ii sailed back to france from dumbarton carrying the five year old queen of scots on board life in france <UNK> pretty and clever according to contemporary accounts mary had a promising childhood with her marriage agreement in place she was sent to france in one five four eight at the age of five to be brought up for the next ten years at the french court she was accompanied by her own little court consisting of two lords two half brothers and the four <UNK> four little girls her own age all named mary and the daughters of the <UNK> families in scotland beaton <UNK> fleming and livingston while in the french court she was a favourite she received the best available education and at the end of her studies she had mastered french latin greek spanish and italian in addition to her native scots she also learned how to play two instruments and learned prose <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on april two four one five five eight she married the dauphin francois at notre dame de paris and on the death of henri ii on july one zero one five five nine became queen consort of france her husband became francois ii of france under the ordinary laws of succession mary was also next in line to the english throne after her cousin queen elizabeth i who was childless however according to the catholic religion elizabeth was illegitimate making mary the true heir although the anti catholic act of settlement would not be passed until one seven zero one the will of henry viii had excluded the <UNK> from succeeding to the english throne mary s troubles were still further increased by the huguenot rising in france called le <UNK> d <UNK> march six one seven one five six zero making it impossible for the french to <UNK> mary s side in scotland the question of the succession was therefore a real one francois ii died on december five one five six zero and mary s mother 
in law catherine de medici became regent for his brother charles ix under the terms of the treaty of edinburgh signed by mary s representatives on july six one five six zero following the death of marie of guise france undertook to withdraw troops from scotland and recognise elizabeth s right to rule england the eighteen year old mary still in france refused to ratify the treaty return to scotland mary stuart the young widow returned to scotland soon after and arrived in <UNK> on august one nine one five six one she was still only one eight and despite her talents her upbringing had not given her the judgment to cope with the dangerous and complex political situation in the scotland of the time religion had divided the people and mary s illegitimate brother james stewart one st earl of moray was a leader of the protestant faction mary being a devout roman catholic was regarded with suspicion by many of her subjects as well as by elizabeth i of england her father s cousin and the monarch of the neighbouring protestant country the protestant reformer john knox preached against mary condemning her for hearing mass dancing dressing too elaborately and many other things real and imagined to the disappointment of the catholic party however mary did not hasten to take up the catholic cause she tolerated the newly established protestant ascendancy and kept james stewart her protestant half brother as her chief advisor in this she may have had to acknowledge her lack of effective military power in the face of the protestant lords however she effectively narrowed her options by joining with james in the destruction of scotland s leading catholic magnate lord <UNK> in one five six two by one five six one mary was having second thoughts about the wisdom of having crossed elizabeth and attempted to make up the breach by inviting her to visit scotland elizabeth refused and the bad blood remained between them mary then sent william maitland of <UNK> as an ambassador to the english court to put the case for mary as a potential heir to the throne elizabeth s response is said to have included the words as for the title of my crown for my time i think she will not attain it however mary in her own letter to her maternal uncle francis duke of guise reports other things that maitland told her including elizabeth s supposed statement that i for my part know none better nor that my self would prefer to her amongst other things elizabeth was <UNK> of the role parliament would have to play in the matter in december one five six one arrangements were made for the two to meet this time in england but elizabeth changed her mind the meeting had been fixed for york or another town in august or september in july elizabeth sent sir henry sidney to call it off because of the civil war in france in one five six three elizabeth made another attempt to <UNK> mary by suggesting she marry robert dudley one st earl of leicester henry sidney s brother in law whom elizabeth trusted and thought she could control dudley being a protestant this would have solved a double problem for elizabeth she sent an ambassador to tell mary that if she would marry someone as yet unnamed of elizabeth s choosing elizabeth would proceed to the inquisition of her right and title to be our next cousin and heir this proposal was rejected at <UNK> palace on july two nine one five six five mary unexpectedly married henry stuart lord <UNK> a descendant of king henry vii of england and mary s half first cousin this marriage to a leading catholic precipitated mary s half brother the earl of moray to join with other protestant lords in open rebellion mary set out for stirling on august two six one five six five to confront them returning to edinburgh to raise more troops the following month moray and the rebellious lords were routed and fled into exile the decisive military action becoming known as the <UNK> raid the union also infuriated elizabeth she felt she should have been asked permission for the marriage to even take place as <UNK> was an english subject elizabeth felt threatened by the marriage because with <UNK> s scottish and english royal blood any child mary would bear <UNK> would have an extremely strong claim to both mary s and elizabeth s thrones her son james did in fact succeed both queens in their respective realms before long mary became pregnant but <UNK> soon became arrogant and demanding insisting on power to go with his courtesy title of king he was jealous of mary s friendship with her private secretary david <UNK> and in march one five six six <UNK> entered into a secret conspiracy with the nobles who had rebelled against mary in the <UNK> raid on the nine th of march a group of the lords accompanied by <UNK> murdered <UNK> while he was in conference with the queen at <UNK> palace this action was the catalyst for the breakdown of their marriage <UNK> soon changed sides again and betrayed the lords but on another occasion he attacked mary and unsuccessfully attempted to cause her to <UNK> their unborn child another image of mary dressed in mourning white following the then recent death of her first husband following the birth of the heir the future james i of england and james vi of scotland in june one five six six a plot was hatched to remove <UNK> who was already ill possibly suffering from syphilis he was <UNK> in a house in edinburgh where mary visited him frequently so that it appeared a reconciliation was in prospect in february one five six seven an explosion occurred in the house and <UNK> was found dead in the garden he appeared to have been strangled this event which 
should have been mary s salvation only harmed her reputation james hepburn four th earl of <UNK> an adventurer who would become her third husband was generally believed to be guilty of the assassination and was brought before a mock trial but acquitted mary attempted to regain support among her lords while <UNK> got some of them to sign the <UNK> tavern bond in which they agreed to support his claims to marry mary on april two four mary visited her son at stirling for the last time on her way back to edinburgh she was abducted willingly or not by <UNK> and his men and taken to dunbar castle where she may have been raped by him on may six they returned to edinburgh and on may one five at <UNK> palace mary and <UNK> were married according to protestant rites the nobility turned against mary and <UNK> and raised an army against them mary and <UNK> confronted the lords at <UNK> hill on june one five but there was no battle as mary agreed to follow the lords on condition that they let <UNK> go but the lords broke their promise and took her to edinburgh and then imprisoned her in loch <UNK> castle situated on an island in the middle of loch <UNK> between july one eight and july two four one five six seven mary <UNK> twins at that castle on july two four she was also forced to abdicate the scottish throne in favour of her one year old son james flight to england mary in captivity c one five seven eight on may two one five six eight she escaped from loch <UNK> and once again managed to raise a small army after her army s defeat at the battle of <UNK> on may one three she fled to england three days later where she was imprisoned by elizabeth s officers at carlisle on may one nine during her imprisonment she famously had the phrase en ma fin g t mon commencement in my end is my beginning embroidered on her cloth of estate after some <UNK> over the question of whether mary should be tried for the murder of <UNK> elizabeth ordered an inquiry rather than a trial it was held in york between october one five six eight and january one five six nine the inquiry was politically influenced elizabeth did not wish to convict mary of murder mary refused to acknowledge the power of any court to try her since she was an anointed queen and the man ultimately in charge of the prosecution james stewart earl of moray was ruling scotland in mary s absence his chief motive was to keep her out of scotland and her supporters under control the case hinged on the casket letters eight letters purportedly from mary to <UNK> reported by james douglas four th earl of morton to have been found in edinburgh in a silver box engraved with an f supposedly for francis ii along with a number of other documents including the mary <UNK> marriage certificate mary was not permitted to see them or to speak in her own defence at the tribunal she refused to offer a written defence unless elizabeth would guarantee a verdict of not guilty which elizabeth would not do although the casket letters were accepted by the inquiry as genuine after a study of the handwriting and of the information contained therein and were generally held to be certain proof of guilt if authentic the inquiry reached the conclusion that nothing was proven from the start this could have been predicted as the only conclusion that would satisfy elizabeth the authenticity of the casket letters has been the source of much controversy among historians the originals were lost in one five eight four and the copies available in various collections do not form a complete set mary argued that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate and it has frequently been suggested either that the letters are complete forgeries that incriminating passages were inserted before the inquiry or that the letters were written to <UNK> by some other person comparisons of writing style have often concluded that they were not mary s work it is impossible now to prove the case either way without them there would have been no case against mary and with hindsight it is difficult to say that any of the major parties involved considered the truth to be a priority elizabeth considered mary s designs on the english throne to be a serious threat and so eighteen years of confinement followed much of it in sheffield castle and sheffield manor in the custody of george talbot six th earl of shrewsbury and his <UNK> wife bess of <UNK> whose daughter elizabeth cavendish married charles stuart <UNK> s brother and produced one child lady <UNK> stuart <UNK> was imprisoned in denmark became insane and died in one five seven eight still in prison in one five eight zero mary s confinement was transferred to sir <UNK> <UNK> and she was under his care for the rest of her life however in one five seven zero elizabeth was persuaded by representatives of charles ix of france to promise to help mary regain her throne as a pre condition she demanded the ratification of the treaty of edinburgh something mary would still not agree to nevertheless william cecil one st baron burghley continued negotiations with mary on elizabeth s behalf the two queens never met in person the <UNK> plot caused elizabeth to think again in one five seven two parliament with the queen s encouragement introduced a bill barring mary from the throne elizabeth unexpectedly refused to give it the royal assent the furthest she ever went was in one five eight four when she introduced a document the bond of association aimed at preventing any would be successor from profiting from her murder it was not legally binding but was signed by thousands 
including mary herself execution mary eventually became a liability that elizabeth could no longer tolerate she was involved in several plots to assassinate elizabeth raise the catholic north of england and put herself on the throne possibly with french or spanish help some of mary s supporters believe that these plots were fabricated one of the london dungeon s exhibitions is about mary queen of scots mary was found guilty of treason by a court of about four zero noblemen including catholics after being involved in the so called <UNK> plot and after giving the go ahead to assassinate elizabeth she was beheaded at <UNK> castle on february eight one five eight seven she chose to wear red thereby declaring herself a catholic martyr the execution was badly carried out it is said to have taken two or according to some accounts three blows to hack off her head various improbable stories about the execution were later circulated one which is thought to be true is that when the executioner picked up the severed head to show it to those present it was discovered that mary was wearing a wig the <UNK> was left holding the wig while the late queen s head rolled on the floor another well known execution story concerns a small dog owned by the queen which is said to have been hiding among her skirts unseen by the spectators following the beheading the dog rushed out terrified and covered in blood it was taken away by her ladies in waiting and washed but it did not survive the shock in response to mary s death the spanish armada sailed to england where they lost a considerable amount of ships and retreated without touching english soil mary was initially buried at peterborough cathedral but her body was exhumed in one six one two when her son king james i of england ordered she be <UNK> in westminster abbey it remains there only thirty feet nine metres from the grave of her cousin elizabeth mary s relics though mary stuart has not been <UNK> by the catholic church many consider her a martyr and there are relics of her her prayer book was long shown in france and her apologist published in an english journal a sonnet which she was said to have composed and to have written with her own hand in this book a celebrated german actress mrs <UNK> <UNK> who excited admiration by her attitudes and performed friedrich schiller s maria with great applause in several german cities affirmed that a cross which she wore on her neck was the very same that once belonged to the unfortunate queen relics of this description have never yet been subjected to the proof of their authenticity but if there is anything which may be reasonably believed to have once been the property of the queen it is the veil with which she covered her head on the scaffold after the executioner had wounded the unfortunate victim in the shoulder by a false blow whether from <UNK> or confusion is uncertain this veil came into the possession of sir j c <UNK> who claimed to be descended from the house of stuart on his mother s side he had an engraving made from it by matteo <UNK> in rome one eight one eight and gave copies to his friends the veil is embroidered with gold <UNK> by as is said the queen s own hand in regular rows crossing each other so as to form small squares and edged with a gold border to which another border has been

commonly used in scotland whereas in ireland one reads of the high king of tara the king of munster etc there is some disagreement about the system of royal succession that was in use at the time one possibility is the system of <UNK> where the <UNK> or heir was chosen from among the male members of the ruling house this was certainly in use in ireland at the time and many scholars believe it was also the custom in scotland there is substantial evidence 
for <UNK> from several sources even up to relatively modern times <UNK> tends to result in the crown s regularly moving from one branch of the royal line to another duncan s naming his son malcolm as his heir in shakespeare s play may represent a <UNK> understanding of the custom others argue that scotland used an old irish pictish matrilineal system of kingship at this time and for nearly another two centuries after under this proposed system the grand chief of scots and picts was always a king but he was eligible to be king because his mother was a ranking princess royal she and the woman who became queen were representatives of the goddess of sovereignty whom the king symbolically married upon his accession kings were thus succeeded by their mother s other sons then their sisters sons then their maternal aunts sons this resulted in the crown traveling from brother to brother uncle to nephew and cousin to cousin a system that became ripe for corruption by ambitious men as the sacred role of <UNK> diminished there is little direct evidence for this system in macbeth s time macbeth s own grandfather malcolm ii was one such ambitious man he wished the crown to be settled upon his grandson duncan son of his daughter <UNK> who had married <UNK> the <UNK> provincial king and abbot of <UNK> this may have been because <UNK> was his favourite daughter or because political alliance with <UNK> was important but more probable is because <UNK> was the elder daughter sometime before his death malcolm ii proceeded to eliminate the heirs to the throne who were ahead of duncan in the succession of these only <UNK> survived then a very young child and rumoured successfully to be half witted having the protection of macbeth did not hurt and being step father and husband of <UNK> bolstered macbeth s own position under the old system when malcolm ii died on november two five one zero three four duncan inherited the throne to challenge duncan s position macbeth formed an alliance with his and duncan s cousin <UNK> earl of orkney son of malcolm ii s youngest daughter they engaged duncan in battle who died fighting them near elgin on august one four one zero four zero macbeth was a strong king and ruled over a kingdom stable enough for him to be able to leave for several months on a pilgrimage to rome he instituted a new form of law and order in scotland his reign was noted as a time of prosperity however in one zero five four malcolm <UNK> duncan s son began his campaign for the throne with the assistance of <UNK> earl of northumbria by capturing the south of scotland macbeth was killed by malcolm s forces at a battle near <UNK> and the throne passed to macbeth s stepson <UNK> in august one zero five seven macbeth is buried on iona scotland s sacred isle and the traditional burial place of high kings of scots and picts at that time some claim the context of the one three th century chronicle of huntingdon which names macbeth a nepos meaning grandson as well as nephew of king malcolm refers to malcolm iii <UNK> rather than malcolm ii but this is impossible since it was malcolm iii <UNK> son of duncan i who succeeded macbeth after defeating him in battle in one zero five seven and killing him either then or shortly thereafter macbeth in fiction william shakespeare s play macbeth is loosely based upon the history in raphael <UNK> s chronicles of

milner and others in the late one nine seven zero s at the university of edinburgh whose syntax is inspired by <UNK> historically ml stands for <UNK> as it was conceived to develop proof tactics in the <UNK> theorem prover the language of which ml was the <UNK> is <UNK> a combination of the first order predicate calculus and the simply typed polymorphic lambda calculus it is known for its use of the <UNK> milner type inference algorithm which can infer the types of most values without requiring the extensive annotation often criticised in languages such as java ml is often referred to as an impure functional language because it permits side effects and therefore imperative programming unlike purely functional programming languages such as haskell features of ml include a call by value evaluation strategy first class functions automatic memory management through garbage collection parametric polymorphism static typing type inference algebraic data types pattern matching and exception handling unlike haskell ml uses eager evaluation which means that all <UNK> are always evaluated one result of this is that you cannot use infinite lists per se however lazy evaluation and hence infinite lists can be simulated through use of anonymous functions today there are several languages in the ml family the two major dialects are standard ml and <UNK> but others exist including

similar to mathematics in facility and syntax the first line of the factorial function shown is optional and describes the types of this function it can be read as the function fac fac has type function from integer to integer fn int int that is it takes an integer as an argument and returns another integer rewritten without the unnecessary type annotation it looks like fun fac zero one fac n n fac n one the second line relies on pattern matching an important part of ml programming note that parameters of a function are not in parentheses but separated by spaces when the function s argument is zero zero it will return the integer one one for all other cases the third line is tried this is the recursion and executes the function again until the base case is reached external links

can be calculated for the following simple machines by using the following formulas lever ma distance from <UNK> to effort effort arm distance from <UNK> to resistance resistance arm wheel and axle a wheel is essentially a lever with one arm the distance between the axle and the outer point of the wheel and the other the radius of the axle typically this is a fairly large difference leading to a <UNK> large mechanical advantage this allows even simple wheels with wooden <UNK> running in wooden blocks to still turn freely because their friction is overwhelmed by the rotational force of the wheel multiplied by the mechanical advantage pulley <UNK> change the direction of a tension force on a flexible material e g a rope or cable in addition <UNK> can be added together to create mechanical advantage by having the flexible material <UNK> over several <UNK> in turn more loops and <UNK> increases the mechanical advantage mechanical advantage consider lifting a weight with rope and <UNK> a rope <UNK> through a pulley attached to a fixed spot e g a barn roof rafter and attached to the weight is called a single fixed pulley it has a ma one assuming <UNK> bearings in the pulley meaning no mechanical advantage or disadvantage however advantageous the change in direction may be a single movable pulley has a ma of two assuming <UNK> bearings in the pulley consider a pulley attached to a weight being lifted a rope passes around it with one end attached to a fixed point above e g a barn roof rafter and a pulling force is applied upward to the other end with the two lengths parallel in this situation the distance the <UNK> must pull the rope becomes twice the distance the weight travels allowing the force applied to be halved note if an additional pulley is used to change the direction of the rope e g the person doing the work wants to stand on the ground instead of on a rafter the mechanical advantage is not increased by looping more ropes around more <UNK> we can continue to increase the mechanical advantage for example if we have two <UNK> attached to the rafter two <UNK> attached to the weight one end attached to the rafter and someone standing on the rafter pulling the rope we have a mechanical advantage of four again note if we add another pulley so that someone may stand on the ground and pull down we still have a mechanical advantage of four here are examples where the fixed point is not obvious a man sits on seat that hangs from a rope that is <UNK> through a pulley attached to a roof rafter above the man pulls down on the rope to lift himself and the seat the pulley is considered a movable pulley and the man and the seat are considered as fixed points ma two a <UNK> strap on a shoe passes through a slot and folds over on itself the slot is a movable pulley and the ma two two ropes laid down a ramp attached to a raised platform a barrel is rolled onto the ropes and the ropes are passed over the barrel and handed to two workers at the top of the ramp the workers pull the ropes together to get the barrel to the top the barrel is a movable pulley and the ma two if the there is enough friction where the rope is <UNK> between the barrel and the ramp the pinch point becomes the attachment point this is considered a fixed attachment point because the rope above the barrel does not move relative to the ramp alternatively the ends of the rope can be attached to the platform inclined plane ma length of 
slope height of slope generally the mechanical advantage is calculated thus ma the distance over which force is applied the distance over which the load is moved also the force exerted in to the machine the distance moved in will always be equal to the force exerted out of the machine the distance moved out for example using a block and tackle with six ropes and a six zero zero pound load the operator would be required to pull the rope six feet and exert one zero zero pounds of force to lift the load one foot this requires an ideal simple machine meaning that there are no losses due to friction or elasticity if friction or elasticity exist in the system efficiency will be lower <UNK> will be greater than <UNK> mechanical advantage also applies to torque a simple <UNK> is able to multiply torque type of mechanical advantage there are two types of mechanical advantage ideal mechanical advantage <UNK> actual mechanical advantage ama ideal mechanical advantage the ideal mechanical advantage is the mechanical advantage of an ideal machine it is usually calculated using physics principles because we have no ideal machine it is theoretical the <UNK> of a machine can be found with the following formula <UNK> de dr where de equals the effort distance and dr equals the resistance distance actual mechanical advantage the actual mechanical advantage is the mechanical advantage of a real machine actual mechanical advantage takes into consideration real world factors such as energy lost in friction in this way it differs from the ideal mechanical advantage which is a sort of theoretical limit to the efficiency the ama of a machine is calculated with the following formula ama r e actual where r is the resistance force e actual is the actual effort force see also

of the twenty two official languages of the country sounds marathi uses the devanagari script for writing marathi script consists of one six vowels and three six consonants making a total of five two letters vowels consonants the combination of the vowels with the k series word formation vowels are combined with consonants using special <UNK> marks to form syllables which are strung together to form a word each vowel has a characteristic mark such as <UNK> for aa <UNK> for i and ii <UNK> for u and <UNK> single or double <UNK> to indicate e ai o and au <UNK> for am and <UNK> for ah syllables which involve i and u are called <UNK> short which require a short pronunciation whereas syllables involving ii and <UNK> are called <UNK> long forms which require stretched or long pronunciation there are two separate marks to indicate <UNK> and <UNK> these are helpful in knowing where the stress lays while pronouncing the word marathi has a complex system to make <UNK> consonant clusters when two or more consecutive consonants are followed by a vowel then a <UNK> cluster is formed the pronunciation of such clusters is <UNK> to the english words like stop <UNK> sweet empty etc <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the letter r is most complex when combined with other consonants and there are four different marks in the script depending on the usage the consonant

different script called the <UNK> script a cursive script designed for minimising the lifting of pen from paper while writing however with the advent of large scale printing <UNK> script fell into disuse as it proved very difficult for type setting see external links the courts in the <UNK> days also used persian type scripts under the influence of muslim and maratha rulers grammar marathi grammar is like hindi or sanskrit with certain variation the most conservative form of marathi is found in old texts like <UNK> s <UNK> or <UNK> s <UNK> gender marathi preserves the neuter gender

in one nine nine eight a dna test further confirmed the identification although some historians speculated soviet troops had killed bormann not long after he left the bunker the presence of glass fragments in the teeth suggest bormann killed himself with a capsule of cyanide when capture became imminent it was widely known among nazi leaders that the allies planned on holding war crimes trials after the end of hostilities and bormann who had taken a major role in the implementation of the holocaust likely knew he would be a central defendant and candidate for judicial execution if captured

varying length from several <UNK> to possible millimeters in axons of nerve cells microtubules serve as structural components within cells and are involved in many cellular processes including mitosis cytokinesis and <UNK> transport structure microtubules are polymers of and <UNK> dimers the <UNK> dimers <UNK> end to end in <UNK> the <UNK> then bundle in a hollow cylindrical filaments typically the <UNK> arrange themselves in an imperfect helix with one turn of the helix containing one three <UNK> dimers each from a different <UNK> the image above illustrates a small section of microtubule a few dimers in length another important feature of microtubule structure is polarity <UNK> <UNK> end to end with the subunit of one <UNK> dimer contacting the subunit of the next therefore in a <UNK> one end will have the subunit exposed while the other end will have the subunit exposed these ends are designated and respectively the <UNK> bundle <UNK> to one another so in a microtubule there is one end the end with only subunits exposed while the other end the end only has subunits exposed organization within cells microtubules are <UNK> and organised by the microtubule organizing centers <UNK> such as <UNK> and basal bodies they are part of a structural network the cytoskeleton within the cell s cytoplasm but in addition to structural support microtubules are used in many other processes as well they are capable of growing and shrinking in order to generate force and there are also motor proteins that move along the microtubule a notable structure involving microtubules is the mitotic spindle used by eukaryotic cells to <UNK> their chromosomes correctly during cell division microtubules are also part of the cilia and flagella of eukaryotic cells <UNK> flagella are entirely different <UNK> and growth polymerization of microtubules is <UNK> in a microtubule organizing center contained within the <UNK> is another type of <UNK> <UNK> which is distinct from the and subunits which compose the microtubules themselves the <UNK> combines with several other associated proteins to form a circular structure known as the <UNK> ring complex this complex acts as a scaffold for <UNK> dimers to begin polymerization it acts as a cap of the end while <UNK> growth continues away from the <UNK> in the direction dynamic instability during polymerization both the and subunits of the <UNK> dimer are bound to a molecule of gtp the gtp bound to <UNK> is stable but the gtp bound to <UNK> may be <UNK> to gdp shortly after assembly the kinetics of gdp <UNK> are <UNK> from those of gtp <UNK> gdp <UNK> is prone to <UNK> a gdp bound <UNK> subunit at the tip of a microtubule will fall off though a gdp bound <UNK> in the middle of a microtubule cannot spontaneously pop out since <UNK> adds onto the end of the microtubule only in the gtp bound state there is generally a cap of gtp bound <UNK> at the tip of the microtubule protecting it from <UNK> when hydrolysis catches up to the tip of the microtubule it begins a rapid <UNK> and <UNK> this switch from growth to shrinking is called a catastrophe gtp bound <UNK> can begin adding to the tip of the microtubule again providing a new cap and protecting the microtubule from shrinking this is referred to as rescue dynamic instability in vivo microtubule dynamics vary considerably assembly <UNK> and catastrophe rates depend on which microtubule associated proteins maps are present chemical effects on microtubule dynamics microtubule dynamics can also be altered by drugs for example the <UNK> drug class e g <UNK> or <UNK> used in the treatment of cancer blocks dynamic instability by stabilizing gdp bound <UNK> in the microtubule thus even when hydrolysis of gtp reaches the tip of the microtubule there is no <UNK> and the microtubule does not shrink back <UNK> and <UNK> have the opposite effect blocking the polymerization of <UNK> into microtubules motor proteins in

provide paramilitary service the word can have four slightly different meanings an official reserve army composed of citizen soldiers the national police forces in russia and other cis countries and the soviet union <UNK> the entire able bodied population of a state which can be called to arms against an invading enemy a private non government force not necessarily directly supported or sanctioned by its government in any of these cases a militia is distinct from a national regular army it can serve to supplement the regular military or it can oppose it for example to resist a military coup in some circumstances the enemies against which a militia is mobilized are domestic political opponents of the government such as strikers in many cases the role or even the existence of a militia is controversial for these reasons legal restrictions may be placed on the mobilization or use of militia australia militia was an alternate name for the citizens military forces <UNK> the reserve units of the australian army between one nine zero one and one nine eight zero after australian federation the six former colonial militias were merged to form the <UNK> initially the <UNK> infantry forces formed the vast bulk of the australian army along with standing artillery and engineer units the defense act of one nine zero three granted the australian federal government the powers to conscript men of military age for home defence however these powers were unpopular and were used only for short periods at a time the government was also forbidden by law from deploying the <UNK> outside australian territories or using it in strikes and other industrial disputes as a result of the ban on foreign service during world war i and world war ii all volunteer australian imperial forces were formed for overseas deployment <UNK> units were sometimes scorned by <UNK> soldiers as chocolate soldiers or <UNK> because they would melt under the pressure of military operations nevertheless some militia units distinguished themselves in action against the empire of japan during the pacific war and suffered extremely high casualties in mid one nine four two militia units fought in two significant battles both in new guinea which was then an australian territory the exploits of the young and poorly trained soldiers of the three nine th militia battalion during the <UNK> action on the <UNK> track remain celebrated to this day as is the contribution of the seven th brigade at the battle of milne bay later in the war the law was changed to allow the transfer of militia units to the two nd <UNK> if six five of the personnel had volunteered for overseas service another change allowed militia units to serve anywhere south of the equator in south east asia consequently they also saw action against japanese forces in the dutch east indies in addition to the <UNK> the volunteer defence corps a volunteer force modeled on the british home guard was formed in one nine four zero and had a strength of almost one zero zero zero zero zero men across australia at its peak after the war <UNK> units continued to form the bulk of the peacetime army although the creation of standing infantry units such as the royal australian regiment from one nine four seven meant that the regular army grew in importance by one nine eight zero when the name of the <UNK> was changed to the army reserve the regular army was the more significant force new zealand many localised militia saw service together with british imperial troops during the new zealand land wars the militia were disbanded and reformed as the territorial army in one nine one one canada in canada the word militia refers to the part time army reserve component of the canadian forces militia troops usually train one night a week and every weekend of the month except in the summer summertime training generally consists of a course and or a call out as well as a longer exercise usually eight one five days a call out can involve any job a soldier might be expected to do staff member on a course ceremonial guard duty etc in addition primary reserve members may volunteer for service with the regular force overseas usually nato or united nations missions reserve courses are often shortened versions of the same regular force course but can use regular force staff members most canadian cities have one or more militia units often these regiments perpetuate famous canadian regiments that are no longer required as part of the regular forces germany switzerland one of the most famous and ancient militia are the swiss militia it is not widely recognized but switzerland maintains proportionally the largest military force in the world with more than twice as many active duty soldiers per capita as the next proportionally largest force in israel having a trained reserve militia of three six of the total population however it should be noted that switzerland has a long tradition of political and military neutrality united kingdom in modern british usage the term paramilitary is more widely used in regard to non government forces such as the <UNK> uda and provisional ira in northern ireland the british military is controlled by the government of the day through parliament which has access to the resources to maintain a standing army until the late one seven th century at various times the crown and parliament were in strong disagreement but parliament s economic ability to use the army was counterbalanced by the crown s traditional ability to organise militia forces the english bill of rights one 
six eight nine declared amongst other things that the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace unless it be with consent of parliament is against law and that the subjects which are protestants may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law the crown still officially controls the use of the army however successive british governments were able to circumvent the intent of the bill of rights through annual continuation notices and the technical legality of the british army in times of peace still rests on these notices a large standing army had come into existence by the mid one nine th century the british government of the day commands it and both declares and wages wars following the creation of a large standing army the word militia fell into disuse in the uk although many units retained the distinction of being designated militia units as extra battalions of regular regiments and irish militia were heavily relied upon to suppress rebellion in ireland the militia was formally disbanded in one nine zero eight with the creation of a reserve force known as the territorial force later the territorial army and the units of the militia were transferred to the special reserve the special reserve were renamed the militia in one nine two one its units were suspended and the militia was disbanded in one nine

squadron the royal militia island of jersey seven three rd regiment royal engineers formerly the royal militia of the island of jersey and first formed in one three three seven also the royal alderney militia created in the one three th century and reformed in one nine eight four is part of the army cadet force thus ensuring the continuation of the name additionally the <UNK> highlanders are a ceremonial private army maintained by the duke of <UNK> they are the only legal private army in the united kingdom united states there is a long history of militias in the united states starting before the country became a country with the colonial militias normally consisting of all adult male citizens this practice was continued after the signing of the u s constitution and remained relatively unchanged until the late one eight zero zero s after the civil war state guard units of select <UNK> were created after one nine zero three the militia was divided into two groups unorganized and organized organized units were created from portions of the former state guards and became state national guard units some states later created state defense forces for assistance in local emergencies private militias not affiliated with any government organization and usually formed by citizens suspicious of the activities and politics of federal and state governments blossomed in the mid one nine nine zero s then faded private militia organizations private militia organizations are organized militia groups which may or may not be <UNK> by their respective government most private militia groups are armed or espouse the use of arms however some groups mostly u s groups espouse political protest and more peaceful means of bringing about political change all private militia organizations hold themselves to a political social or religious ideology left wing militia the left wing politics wing militias generally consider themselves to be freedom fighters and run the gamut of leftist causes from the national liberation movements under foreign occupation to the various terrorist groups such as the red brigades and communist guerillas in central america as their funding and armament in the two zero th century came almost entirely from the soviet union maoist china one nine four nine one nine seven six and other marxist leninist states many of these organizations declined in their activities during the one nine nine zero s as these governments fell or changed their nature for information on u s left wing militia groups see efficacy of militias against modern armies as noted above there is much disagreement about the ability of even the best organized militia to resist a modern regular army however irregular forces do have several points in their favor including familiarity with local terrain dedication assuming one s home is being threatened <UNK> and no obligation to fight by the rules the famed successes of boer and american snipers against british volley fire during their respective wars for independence are prime examples in more modern times during the warsaw ghetto uprising a handful of untrained and poorly armed polish jews held off an entire wehrmacht division for roughly six weeks during the liquidation of that city s ghetto although the uprising was eventually ended by artillery fire the german ninth army was able to accomplish very little throughout most of one nine four three as a direct result of this action many modern observers have pointed out that the invasion of poland took only three weeks and speculate that such resistance early in the war could have stopped the blitzkrieg in its mechanized tracks indeed the usa is facing a similar situation in iraq i e a swift victory over conventional military opponent followed by an intractable insurgency also in wwii the french resistance armed mainly with captured german weapons and supplied by allied air drops were able to cause many disruptions to the nazis which aided greatly during and after the allied invasion of one nine four four in the united states there were widespread fears of a japanese invasion of the largely <UNK> west coast some military experts at the time suggested <UNK> at the mississippi river in case of such an invasion on the assumption anything west of that point would be impossible to defend such an invasion never materialized and there are rumors of uncertain authenticity suggesting that the japanese feared a rifle 
behind every blade of grass a reference to the ubiquity of skill at arms in the american west at that time although this theory completely <UNK> the impossible logistics of such an operation furthermore when an allied invasion of japan appeared to be imminent later in the war the japanese government began arming its populace with bamboo spears even to the well armed and mechanized allied forces the prospect of facing such a foe was daunting and millions of allied and japanese casualties were expected this was a major factor in the decision to use nuclear weapons at hiroshima and nagasaki another case of the effectiveness of irregular forces is that of the anti government forces in iraq although the regular forces and republican guard were quickly crushed in the open by the invading coalition the insurgency is estimated to continue perhaps another one two years switzerland s continued neutrality during world war ii is often seen to be due to the well armed and well

packet switched network <UNK> operates at a osi model layer that is generally considered to lie between traditional definitions of layer two data link layer and layer three network layer and thus is often referred to as a layer two five protocol it was designed to provide a unified data carrying service for both circuit based clients and packet switching clients which provide a datagram service model it can be used to carry many different kinds of traffic including ip packets as well as native atm <UNK> and ethernet frames background a number of different technologies were previously deployed with essentially identical goals such as frame relay and atm <UNK> is now replacing these technologies in the marketplace mostly because it is better aligned with current and future technology and needs in particular <UNK> <UNK> with the cell switching and signalling protocol baggage of atm <UNK> recognizes that small atm cells are not needed in the core of modern networks since modern optical networks as of two zero zero one are so fast at one zero gbit s and well beyond that even full length one five zero zero byte packets do not incur significant real time queuing delays the need to reduce such delays to support voice traffic having been the motivation for the cell nature of atm at the same time it attempts to preserve the traffic engineering and out of band control that made frame relay and atm attractive for deploying large scale networks <UNK> was originally proposed by a group of engineers from cisco systems inc it was called tag switching when it was a cisco proprietary proposal and was renamed label switching when it was handed over to the ietf for open standardization one original motivation was to allow the creation of simple high speed switches since it was at one point thought to be impossible to forward ip packets entirely in hardware however advances in vlsi have made such devices possible the systemic advantages of <UNK> such as the ability to support multiple service models do traffic management etc remain how <UNK> works <UNK> works by <UNK> packets with an <UNK> header containing one or more labels this is called a label stack <UNK> packet each label stack entry contains four fields a two zero bit label value a three bit experimental field reserved for future use a one bit bottom of stack flag if this is set it signifies the current label is the last in the stack an eight bit ttl time to live field these <UNK> labeled packets are forwarded switched is the correct term after a label lookup switch instead of a lookup into the ip table label lookup and label switching may be faster than usual rib lookup because it can take place directly into fabric and not cpu the exit points of an <UNK> network are called label edge routers ler routers that are performing routing based only on label switching are called label switch routers <UNK> remember that a ler is not usually the one that is popping the label for more information see penultimate hop popping devices that function as ingress and or <UNK> routers are often called pe provider edge routers devices that function only as transit routers are similarly called p provider routers the job of a p router is significantly easier than that of a pe router so they can be less complex and may be more dependable because of this when an <UNK> packet enters the ingress router and needs to be passed on to an <UNK> tunnel the router first determines the forwarding equivalence class the packet should be in and then inserts one or more labels in the packet s newly created <UNK> header the packet is then passed on to the next hop router for this tunnel when a labeled packet is received by an <UNK> router the topmost label is examined based on the contents of the label a swap push 
or pop operation can be performed on the packet s label stack routers can have <UNK> lookup tables that tell them which kind of operation to do based on the topmost label of the incoming packet so they can process the packet very quickly in a swap operation the label is swapped with a new label and the packet is forwarded along the path associated with the new label in a push operation a new label is pushed on top of the existing label effectively <UNK> the packet in another layer of <UNK> this allows the hierarchical routing of <UNK> packets notably this is used by <UNK> <UNK> in a pop operation the label is removed from the packet which may reveal an inner label below this process is called <UNK> if the popped label was the last on the label stack the packet leaves the <UNK> tunnel this is usually done by the <UNK> router but see php below during these operations the contents of the packet below the <UNK> label stack are not examined indeed transit routers typically need only to examine the topmost label on the stack the forwarding of the packet is done based on the contents of the labels which allows protocol independent packet forwarding that does not need to look at a protocol dependent routing table and avoids the expensive ip longest prefix match at each hop at the <UNK> router when the last label has been popped only the payload remains this can be an ip packet or any of a number of other kinds of payload packet the <UNK> router must therefore have routing information for the packet s payload since it must forward it without the help of label lookup tables an <UNK> transit router has no such requirement in some special cases the last label can also be popped off at the penultimate hop the hop before the <UNK> router this is called penultimate hop popping php this may be interesting in cases where the <UNK> router has lots of packets leaving <UNK> tunnels and thus spends <UNK> amounts of cpu time on this by using php transit routers connected directly to this <UNK> router effectively <UNK> it by popping the last label themselves since the <UNK> router will do a higher layer routing table lookup anyway the amount of higher layer work needed for a previously popped packet remains the same and the actual label popping need not be done <UNK> can make use of existing atm network infrastructure as its labelled flows can be mapped to atm virtual circuit identifiers and vice versa installing and removing <UNK> paths there are two standardized protocols for managing <UNK> paths ldp label distribution protocol and <UNK> te an extension of the <UNK> protocol for traffic engineering an <UNK> header does not identify the type of data carried inside the <UNK> path if one wants to carry two different types of traffic between two routers or ask for different treatment from the core routers for each type one has to establish one <UNK> path for each type of traffic the experimental bits and <UNK> the undefined experimental bits are used by most of the <UNK> vendors to carry the latest three of five <UNK> priority bits in ipv four header as a simple emulation of <UNK> more priorities fair queuing classification and <UNK> in the core and some other achievements of the ip <UNK> are not possible with <UNK> comparison of <UNK> versus ip <UNK> cannot be compared to ip as a separate entity because it works in conjunction with ip and ip s <UNK> routing protocols <UNK> gives ip networks simple traffic engineering the ability to transport layer three ip <UNK> with overlapping address spaces and support for layer two pseudo wires with any transport over <UNK> atom see martini draft routers with programmable cpus and without <UNK> cam or another method for fast lookups may also see a limited increase in performance <UNK> relies on <UNK> routing protocols to construct its label forwarding table and the scope of any <UNK> is usually restricted to a single carrier for stability and policy reasons as there is still no standard for carrier carrier <UNK> it is not possible to have the same <UNK> service layer two or layer three <UNK> covering more than one operator comparison of <UNK> versus atm <UNK> can not be compared directly to atm as they are totally different technologies with different goals <UNK> allows a very smooth migration for ip only services on atm networks without the need to support of complex signalling and routing protocols like <UNK> as a large proportion of the data transported over atm networks in the late one nine nine zero s was ip it was cheaper to upgrade some switches to support <UNK> instead of <UNK> <UNK> packets can be much larger than atm cells with the difference that they have variable length atm cells have fixed size of five three bytes today s networks usually must be able to transport packets at least one five zero zero bytes long because this is the ubiquitous maximum size for ethernet but any <UNK> payload size being the size of the encapsulated payload plus the size required for all the labels that the network interfaces in use will allow can be transported note that this requires the use of baby jumbo packets if ethernet is used as the transport for <UNK> this compares well with the four eight byte cell of atm and reduces encapsulation <UNK> particularly in the case of small packets for example it allows a minimum length tcp packet to reside in a single <UNK> packet rather than two cells as in atm the one six bits of vci and eight bits of <UNK> in the atm cell are replaced by a single label field of two zero bits packed into a three two bit label header the three two bit <UNK> label field also contains an eight bit time 
to live field a top of stack bit and three spare bits for expansion although fewer bits are available for the label labels can be stacked to create arbitrarily complex <UNK> label stacks this makes addressing and <UNK> in <UNK> vastly more flexible than in atm as there is no need to impose an arbitrary boundary between vp and vc switching <UNK> deployment <UNK> is currently in use in large ip only networks and is standardized by ietf in rfc three zero three one in practice <UNK> is mainly used to forward ip datagrams and ethernet traffic major applications of <UNK> are telecommunications traffic engineering and <UNK> <UNK> competitors to <UNK> <UNK> can exist currently only in an ipv four environment ipv four routing protocols and provides limited additional functionality the major goal of <UNK> development the increase of routing speed is no longer relevant because of the usage of asic <UNK> and cam based switching therefore the major usage of <UNK> is to implement limited traffic engineering and layer three layer two service provider type <UNK> over existing ipv four networks the only competitors to <UNK> are technologies like l two <UNK> three that also provide

resentment among the soldiers this was compounded by the rolling back of the privileges they had enjoyed under caracalla and the introduction of a pay system by which recruits received less than veterans after only a short while the legions were searching for a rival emperor his popularity also suffered in rome not only had the new emperor failed to visit the city after taking power but a

minos of crete and designed by the architect daedalus to hold the minotaur the minotaur was eventually killed by theseus minotaur is greek for bull of minos the bull was also known as <UNK> or <UNK> a name shared with minos s foster father the story before minos became king he asked the greek god poseidon for a sign to assure him that he and not his brother was to receive the throne poseidon agreed to send a white bull on condition minos would sacrifice the bull back to the god indeed a bull of unmatched beauty came out of the sea king minos after seeing it found it so beautiful that he instead sacrificed another bull hoping that poseidon would not notice poseidon was very angry when he realized what had been done so he caused minos s wife <UNK> to be overcome with a fit of madness in which she fell in love with the bull <UNK> went to daedalus for assistance and daedalus devised a way for her to satisfy her passions he constructed a hollow wooden cow covered with <UNK> for <UNK> to hide in and allow the bull to mount her the result of this union was the minotaur in some accounts the white bull went on to become the cretan bull captured by heracles also known as hercules for one of his labours the minotaur had the body of a man and the head and tail of a bull it was a fierce creature and minos after getting advice from the oracle at delphi had daedalus construct a gigantic labyrinth to hold the minotaur it was located under minos palace in knossos now it happened that <UNK> son of minos had been killed by the athenians who were jealous of the victories he had won at the <UNK> festival to avenge the death of his son minos waged war and won he then demanded that seven athenian youths and seven maidens be sent every ninth year to be devoured by the minotaur when the third sacrifice came round theseus volunteered to go to slay the monster he promised to his father aegeus that he would put up a white sail on his journey back home ariadne minos daughter fell in love with theseus and helped him get out of the maze by giving him a ball of thread allowing him to <UNK> his path theseus killed the minotaur with a magical sword ariadne had given him and led the other athenians back out the labyrinth plutarch theseus one five one nine <UNK> sic i i six iv six one apollodorus iii one one five however theseus forgot to put up the white sails so his father started crying and fell into the sea then it became known as the aegean sea minos angry that theseus was able to escape imprisoned daedalus and his son icarus in the labyrinth they were able to escape by building wings for themselves but icarus died during the escape as he flew too high and the wax which held the feathers in the wing melted as it was closer to the sun sometimes the minotaur is represented as a bull with a human torso and head like a bull version of the centaur theseus battles the minotaur on a black figure vase interpretations the contest between theseus and the minotaur was frequently represented in greek art a <UNK> <UNK> exhibits on one side the labyrinth on the other the minotaur surrounded by a <UNK> of small balls probably intended for stars it is to be noted that one of the monster s names was <UNK> the ruins of minos palace at knossos have been found but the labyrinth has not the enormous number of rooms <UNK> and corridors in the palace has led archaeologists to believe that the palace itself was the source of the labyrinth myth some modern <UNK> regard the minotaur as a solar personification and a greek adaptation of the baal <UNK> of the phoenicians the slaying of the minotaur by theseus in that case indicates the abolition of such sacrifice by the advance of greek civilization according to a b cook minos and minotaur are only different forms of the same personage representing the sun god zeus of the cretans who depicted the sun as a bull he and j g frazer both explain <UNK> s union with the bull as a sacred ceremony at which the queen of knossos was <UNK> to a bull formed god just as the wife of the tyrant in athens was <UNK> to dionysus e <UNK> who does not dispute the historical personality of minos in view of the

name given by vannevar bush to the theoretical proto hypertext computer system he proposed in his one nine four five the atlantic monthly article as we may think the <UNK> has had tremendous influence on the development of <UNK> hypertext and general intellect <UNK> computer systems details a proto hypertext system bush described the device as electronically linked to a library and able to display books and films from the library and automatically follow cross references from one work to another the <UNK> not only offered linked information to a user but was also a tool for establishing the links the technology used would have been a combination of electromechanical controls and microfilm cameras and readers all integrated into a large desk most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will the technology of the <UNK> is often confused with that of hypertext although bush s idea inspired the creation of hypertext it is not considered to be hypertext the <UNK> as proposed by bush could only create links between a pair of microfilm frames but it could not create links in the modern sense where a <UNK> can be based on a single word phrase or picture within a document associative trails furthermore bush s crude notion of associative trails has generally not been implemented in the vast majority of hypertext systems an associative trail as conceived by bush would be a way to create a new linear sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described the closest analogy with the modern web browser would be to create a list of bookmarks pointing to articles relevant to a topic and then to have some mechanism for automatically scrolling through the articles modern hypertext systems with word and phrase level linking offer more sophistication in connecting relevant information other features however the <UNK> also had other features the user could generate new information on microfilm such as by taking photos from paper or from a touch sensitive translucent screen as observers like tim <UNK> have pointed out the <UNK> could be considered to be a microfilm based precursor to the personal computer the september one zero one nine four five life magazine article showed the first illustrations of what the <UNK> desk could look like as well as illustrations of a head mounted camera which a scientist could wear while doing experiments and a typewriter capable of voice recognition and of reading text by speech synthesis taken together these <UNK> machines were probably the earliest practical description of what we would call today the office of the future missing features search and metadata the system had no automatic search nor a universal metadata scheme such as a standard library classification or an hypertext element set like the dublin core instead when the user made an entry such as a new or annotated manuscript <UNK> or image he was expected to index and describe it in his personal code book by consulting his code book the user could <UNK> annotated and generated entries criticism michael <UNK> suggested the <UNK> was severely flawed because bush did not thoroughly understand information science nor microfilm <UNK> also criticizes bush for inadequate research bush did not mention either the related microfilm based workstation proposed by leonard townsend in one nine three eight or the more detailed microfilm and electronics based selector patented by emmanuel goldberg in one nine three one legacy this idea directly influenced computer pioneers j c r licklider see his one nine six zero paper man computer symbiosis douglas engelbart see his one nine six two report <UNK> human intellect and also led to ted nelson s groundbreaking work in concepts of hypermedia and hypertext as we may think also predicted many kinds of technology invented after its publication in addition to hypertext such as personal computers the internet the world wide web speech recognition and online encyclopedias such as wikipedia wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them ready to be dropped into the <UNK> and there amplified vannevar s influence is still evident in research laboratories of today in both gordon bell s project <UNK> from microsoft research as well as richard <UNK> and frank <UNK> s walden s paths project from texas a as we may think the original article from the atlantic monthly archives as we may think a celebration of vannevar bush s one nine four five vision at brown university history of computing <UNK> interaction for the musical use of modulation see modulation music modulation is the process of varying a carrier signal typically a sinusoidal signal in order to use that signal to convey information the three key parameters of a <UNK> are its amplitude its phase and its frequency all of which can be modified in accordance with an information signal to obtain the modulated signal there are several reasons to modulate a signal before transmission in a medium these include the ability of different users sharing a medium multiple access and making the signal properties physically compatible with the propagation medium a device that performs modulation is known as a modulator and a device that performs the inverse operation of <UNK> is known as a <UNK> a device that can do both operations is a modem a contraction of the two terms in digital modulation the changes in the signal are chosen from a fixed list the modulation alphabet each entry of which conveys a different possible piece of information a symbol the alphabet is often conveniently represented on a constellation diagram in analog modulation the change is applied continuously in response to 
the data signal the modulation may be applied to various aspects of the signal as the lists below indicate modulation is generally performed to overcome signal transmission issues such as to allow easy low loss low dispersion propagation as electromagnetic waves multiplexing the transmission of multiple data signals in one frequency band on different carrier frequencies smaller more directional antennas carrier signals are usually high frequency electromagnetic waves analog modulation techniques phase modulation pm frequency modulation fm amplitude modulation am single sideband modulation <UNK> or <UNK> am very similar to single sideband suppressed carrier modulation <UNK> sc <UNK> sideband modulation <UNK> or <UNK> am sigma delta modulation digital modulation techniques any form of digital modulation necessarily uses a finite number of distinct signals to represent digital data in the case of <UNK> a finite number of phases are used in the case of <UNK> a finite number of frequencies are used in the case of ask a finite number of amplitudes are used this is very similar to pulse code modulation each of these phases frequencies or amplitudes are assigned a unique pattern of binary bits usually each phase frequency or amplitude encodes an equal number of bits this number of bits comprises the symbol that is represented by the particular phase these are the general steps used by the modulator to transmit data accept incoming digital data group the data into symbols use these symbols to set or change the phase frequency or amplitude of the reference signal appropriately pass the modulated signal on for further processing such as filtering and channel coding before transmission at the receiver the <UNK> is passed the de filtered and de channel coded signal determines its phase frequency or amplitude maps the phase frequency or <UNK> to its corresponding symbol translates the symbol into its individual bits passes the resultant bit stream on for further processing such as removal of any error correcting codes as is common to all digital communication systems the design of both the modulator and <UNK> must be done simultaneously digital modulation schemes are possible because the transmitter receiver pair have prior knowledge of how data is encoded and represented in the communications system in all digital communication systems both the modulator at the transmitter and the <UNK> at the receiver are structured so that they perform inverse operations the principal classes of modulation are phase shift keying <UNK> frequency shift keying <UNK> and audio frequency shift keying <UNK> minimum shift keying <UNK> gaussian minimum shift keying <UNK> very minimum shift keying <UNK> amplitude shift keying ask and its most common form on off keying <UNK> <UNK> amplitude modulation qam a combination of <UNK> and ask continuous phase modulation cpm <UNK> coded modulation tcm also known as <UNK> modulation <UNK> and <UNK> are particular cases of continuous phase modulation cpm indeed <UNK> is a particular case of the sub family of cpm known as continuous phase frequency shift keying <UNK> which is defined by a rectangular frequency pulse i e a linearly increasing phase pulse of one symbol time duration total response signalling often incorrectly referred to as a modulation scheme orthogonal frequency division multiplexing <UNK> usually takes advantage of one of the digital techniques it is also known as discrete <UNK> dmt when <UNK> is used in conjunction with channel coding techniques it is described as coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing <UNK> <UNK> is strictly a channel access method and not a modulation scheme pulse modulation these are hybrid digital and analogue techniques pulse

macintosh computers it is also sold separately as an upgrade for recent existing macintosh computers that do not have the latest major release of mac os x mac os x server is architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart but usually runs on apple s line of macintosh server hardware mac os x server includes <UNK> management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services including a mail server a samba server a directory server and a domain name server history main article mac os x history despite its branding as simply version one zero of the mac os mac os x has a history that is almost completely independent of the earlier mac os releases mac os x is based on the mach kernel and the bsd implementation of unix which were incorporated into nextstep the object oriented operating system developed by steve jobs next company after he left apple in one nine eight five meanwhile during the years without jobs at the helm apple attempted to create a next generation operating system of its own see <UNK> and <UNK> with little success eventually next s os called <UNK> at the time was selected to form the basis for apple s next os and apple purchased next outright jobs was re hired and later returned to the leadership of the company <UNK> the transformation of the programmer friendly <UNK> into a system that would be welcomed by apple s primary market of home users and creative professionals as a project known as rhapsody after some <UNK> which threatened the loyalty of independent developers to mac os and changes of strategy to ease the transition from mac os nine to the new system rhapsody evolved into mac os x initially apple attempted to retain backwards compatibility 
with existing macintosh software by including the classic mode of operation which allowed the previous operating system os nine to run within os x supporting applications that weren t capable of running natively on os x however in january two zero zero six apple began shipping macintosh computers with intel x eight six microprocessors rather than powerpc microprocessors the version of mac os x included with these new intel systems no longer includes the classic backwards compatibility apple has developed an emulation service named rosetta which allows powerpc applications to run on intel machines albeit slightly slower than they would normally description the box for mac os x v one zero four tiger mac os x is a radical departure from previous macintosh operating systems as its underlying code base is completely different from previous versions mac os x includes a number of features that are intended to make the operating system more stable and reliable than apple s previous operating systems pre emptive multitasking and memory protection are intended to improve the ability of the operating system to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other as was possible under previous versions also the mac os x kernel is based on the pre existing <UNK> kernel which as well as making mac os x easier to maintain than the previous mac os <UNK> the transition from one platform to another for example the initial transition to the powerpc platform after apple s purchase of next as it was designed with portability in mind nextstep having been ported from the original six eight k based next workstations to pa risc sparc x eight six based machines the most visible change was the aqua graphical user interface the use of soft edges translucent colors and <UNK> similar to the hardware of the first <UNK> brought more color and texture to the windows and controls on the desktop than os nine s platinum appearance had offered initially the new aqua look raised a great deal of controversy among users many older macintosh users decried the interface as <UNK> and lacking in professional polish while others hailed the new interface as another revolutionary apple innovation in the consistent look and theme of the human interface regardless the look was instantly recognizable and even before the first version of mac os x was released third party developers started producing skins for customizable applications like <UNK> similar to the aqua appearance to some extent apple has used its successful transition to this new design as leverage at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software which provides an interface which they claim is derived from their copyrighted design the core of mac os x is an open source unix like operating system built around the <UNK> kernel with standard unix facilities available from the command line interface shortly before the release of mac os x apple released this core as darwin on top of this core apple designed and developed a number of proprietary closed source components including the aqua user interface and the finder analogous to the windows explorer compatibility powerpc versions of mac os x retain compatibility with older mac os applications by providing an emulation environment called classic which allows users to run mac os nine as a process within mac os x so that most older applications run as they would under the older operating system in addition the carbon apis for mac os nine and mac os x were created to permit code to be written to run natively on both systems the <UNK> apis are still available but apple now calls the technology cocoa this heritage is visible in the cocoa apis in which the class names mostly begin with ns for nextstep a fourth option for developers is to write applications in the java platform which mac os x has supported as a first class citizen in practice this means that java applications fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross platform and that guis while being written in swing look almost exactly like native cocoa interfaces traditionally cocoa programs have been mostly written in objective c with java as an alternative however on july one one two zero zero five apple announced that features added to cocoa in mac os x versions later than one zero four will not be added to the cocoa java programming interface mac os x can run many bsd or linux software packages as long as they have been compiled for the platform compiled binaries are normally distributed as mac os x packages but some may require command line configuration or compilation projects such as fink and <UNK> provide <UNK> or <UNK> packages for many standard packages since version one zero three mac os x has included x one one app the company s version of the x one one graphical interface for unix applications as an optional component during installation apple s implementation is based on <UNK> eight six four three and x one one r six six with a window manager which mimics the mac os x look closer integration with mac os x and extensions to use the native quartz rendering system and to accelerate opengl earlier versions of mac os x can run x one one applications using <UNK> for the early releases of mac os x the standard hardware platform supported was the line of macintosh computers laptop desktop or server based on powerpc g three g four and g five processors later versions of mac os x discontinued support for some older hardware for example panther does not support beige g three s and tiger does not support systems that pre date apple s introduction of firewire ports generically known as ieee one three nine four however free tools such as <UNK> have enabled installation of mac os x on certain older systems not officially supported by apple including some pre g three systems 
the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware and performance enhancements possible only with more advanced equipment e g graphics acceleration on june six two zero zero five steve jobs announced in his keynote address at the annual apple worldwide developers conference that apple will be <UNK> from powerpc to intel processors over the following two years and that mac os x will support both platforms during this transition the last time that apple switched cpu families from the motorola six eight k cpu to the ibm motorola powerpc apple included a motorola six eight k emulator in the new os when running a powerpc cpu that made almost all six eight k software work automatically with legacy hardware apple has supported the six eight k emulator for one one years now but will drop the support of the six eight k emulator now because they will still be supporting the powerpc and also supporting the macs with intel cpu family cpus included in the new os for the intel based macs is a new emulator named rosetta which will allow users to automatically be able to run mac os x powerpc software on an intel based mac software on the new intel macs will be supported in three ways one legacy os x powerpc software will automatically work by using the rosetta emulator which is included with the new os that runs on intel based macs and two developers were encouraged to develop universal binaries that are two applications in one one application is powerpc machine code and the other is intel machine code the user will just open what looks like one application and depending upon which cpu the mac has the appropriate version of the application will be run automatically the third option that developers have but is not recommended as of feb two zero zero six is three intel only mac os x applications that will run only on the new intel based macs and on the newest version of mac os x option three will likely start to be the norm several years from now when the demand for powerpc software drops off with each mac os x system sold apple includes their own professional development tools the ide is called <UNK> this currently is version two two one with <UNK> you can develop c c cocoa objective c java etc and just check any combination of versions that you want to develop you just check one powerpc only two intel only or three both <UNK> and a universal binary is generated which is what most developers are doing at this time and for the foreseeable future to preserve investment in hardware purchases for apple s press release announcing the transition to intel see support for the powerpc platform will remain in version one zero five though it is unclear how long this dual architecture support will be continued but since apple supported the motorola six eight k family for eleven years after the introduction of powerpc systems it s likely that they will support the powerpc macs for many years to come a new version of <UNK> supports building universal binaries that will run on either architecture powerpc binaries will be supported on intel based macs using an emulator called rosetta jobs also confirmed rumors that apple has had versions of mac os x running on intel processors for most of its developmental life such <UNK> capability already existed in os x s lineage the predecessor of os x <UNK> had been ported to many architectures including intel s x eight six and a port to x eight six of the core operating system of os x darwin has been available as a free download since os x was first released however apple has stated that os x for x eight six platforms will not support the classic environment also note that apple stated that <UNK> would only run on apple x eight six systems not pcs but several people have been using a development version of the os on x eight six pcs see links below notable features uses a subset of the portable document format pdf as the basis of its quartz imaging model full color

comes included in the price for new macs minor upgrades are free and can be downloaded using software update major upgrades cost us one two nine from apple the disc purchased can be used to either update the existing operating system or install a new version there is also a more highly priced server version mac os x server there is also a family version of mac os x that has a license for home use for users who have more than one mac at home for one nine nine nine nine suggested the apple developer connection <UNK> offers deals where developers can register for access to additional developer tools such as <UNK> for free for mac os x <UNK> also provides developers with selected shipping versions of os x and beta versions of the operating system in comparison to microsoft windows some critics point to the lack of upgrade pricing for upgrading to a new major release on mac os x users of previous versions have to pay full price for a new version this is in part a semantic argument depending on whether a retail mac os x package is considered an upgrade or not on one hand it can only be used on a mac all of which were sold with some version of the mac os so it is arguably an upgrade on the other hand no price distinction is made between upgrading version nine zero or version one zero three to version one zero four suggesting that consumers are buying a full license in either case or at least receiving no credit for intervening upgrades furthermore customers who purchase a macintosh between the time a new version of mac os x is announced and the time it starts shipping <UNK> on new machines have typically been given upgrades at a much smaller cost nine nine five one nine nine five usd naming the character x is a roman numeral and is officially pronounced ten continuing the numbering of previous macintosh operating systems such as mac os eight and mac os nine however it is a common mistake to read it as the letter x and pronounce it ex one possible reason for this interpretation is the tradition of giving unix like operating systems names that contain the letter x aix a ux hp ux irix linux minix <UNK> <UNK> next another possible reason is apple s tendency to refer to specific versions in print for example mac os x version one zero four mac os x versions are named after big cats prior to its release version one zero zero was code named cheetah internally at apple and version one zero one was code named internally as puma after the immense buzz surrounding version one zero two codenamed jaguar apple s product marketing began openly using the code name to promote the operating system one zero three was similarly marketed as panther version one zero four is marketed as tiger leopard has been announced as the name for the

however on one six may two zero zero five the florida federal court ruled that apple s use of the name tiger does not infringe upon tiger direct s trademark also java version five zero also known as

puma jaguar panther and tiger internally apple uses a build number to identify each development version of mac os x there may be many development versions each week under apple s guidelines the first development version of a product starts with build one a one minor revisions to that are one a two one a three one a four and so on the first major development revision becomes one b one and minor revisions to that would be one b two one b three etc the next major revision would be one c one and so forth the next major revision after the last one series would be two a followed by two b the transition from one letter to the next occurs with changes in the minor release number for instance the first build of panther one zero three was seven a one the first public release was seven b eight five the last one zero three nine was seven w nine eight but the next build of os x was one zero four eight a one when a build is chosen as the next public release of mac os x it is given a public version number build four k seven eight was chosen to be mac os x version one zero zero build five g six four became one zero one build six c one one five became one zero two build seven b eight five became one zero three and build eight a four two eight became one zero four the current version of mac os x is one zero four five released on february one four two zero zero six one zero four four was

users mac os x v one zero zero cheetah on march two four two zero zero one apple released mac os x v one zero zero internally codenamed cheetah the initial version was slow not feature complete and had very few applications available at the time of its launch mostly from independent developers many critics suggested that while the os was not ready for mainstream adoption they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base for which to improve upon simply releasing os x was received by the macintosh community as a great accomplishment for attempts to completely overhaul the mac os had been underway since one nine nine six and delayed by countless setbacks following a few minor bug fixes kernel <UNK> became much less frequent and mac os x began garnering praise for its stability at an early point in its development it was criticized for being slow with performance not much improved over the previous september s release of mac os x public beta mac os x v one zero one puma later that year on september two five two zero zero one mac os x v one zero one internally codenamed puma was released increasing the performance of the system as well as providing missing features such as dvd playback apple released one zero one as a free upgrade cd for one zero zero users in addition to the us one two nine boxed version for people running only mac os nine it was discovered that the upgrade cds were actually full install cds that could be used with mac os nine systems by removing a specific file apple subsequently re released the cds in an actual stripped down

the <UNK> of love which was later picked up by the steve miller band as the <UNK> of love american musical groups morphology is a sub discipline of linguistics that studies word structure while words are generally accepted as being the smallest units of syntax it is clear that in most if not all languages words can be related to other words by rules for example any english speaker can see that the words dog dogs and dog catcher are closely related english speakers can also recognize that these relations can be formulated as rules that can apply to many many other pairs of words dog is to dogs just as cat is to cats or encyclop dia is to encyclop dias dog is to dog catcher as dish is to <UNK> the rule in the first case is plural formation in the second case a transitive verb and a noun playing the role of its object can form a word morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies such rules across and within languages the term was coined by august schleicher in one eight five nine f r die <UNK> von der <UNK> w <UNK> ich das wort <UNK> for the science of word formation i choose the term morphology m <UNK> acad imp <UNK> seven one seven three five important concepts <UNK> and word forms the word word is ambiguous in common usage to take up again the example of dog vs dogs there is one sense in which these two are the same word they are both nouns that refer to the same kind of animal differing only in number and another sense in which they are different words they can t generally be used in the same sentences without altering other words to fit for example the verbs is and are in the dog is happy and the dogs are happy the distinction between these two senses of word is probably the most important one in morphology the first sense of word the one in which dog and dogs are the same word is called lexeme the second sense is called word form we thus say that dog and dogs are different forms of the same lexeme dog and dog catcher on the other hand are different <UNK> for example they refer to two different kinds of entities the form of a word that is chosen conventionally to represent the canonical form of a word is called a lemma or citation form inflection vs word formation given the notion of a lexeme it is possible to distinguish two kinds of morphological rules some morphological rules relate different forms of the same lexeme while other rules relate two different <UNK> rules of the first kind are called inflectional rules while those of the second kind are called word formation the english plural as illustrated by dog and dogs is an inflectional rule compounds like dog catcher or <UNK> are an example of a word formation rule informally word formation forms new words that is <UNK> while inflection gives you more forms of the same word lexeme there is a further distinction between two kinds of word formation derivation and compounding compounding is a kind of word formation which involves combining complete word forms into a compound dog catcher is a compound because both dog and catcher are words derivation involves suffixes or prefixes that are not independent words the word independent is derived from the word dependent by <UNK> it with the <UNK> prefix in and dependent itself is derived from the verb depend the distinction between inflection and word formation is not at all clear cut there are many examples where linguists fail to agree whether a given rule is inflection or word formation however the next section will clarify this distinction further paradigms and <UNK> the notion of a paradigm is closely related to that of inflection the paradigm of a lexeme is the set of all of its word forms organized by their grammatical categories the familiar examples of paradigms are the conjugations of verbs and the declensions of nouns the word forms of a lexeme can usually be arranged into tables by classifying them by shared features such as tense aspect mood number gender or case for example the personal pronouns in english can be organized into tables using the categories of person number gender and case the categories used to group word forms into paradigms cannot be chosen arbitrarily they must be categories that are relevant to stating the syntactic rules of the language for example person and number are categories that can be used to define paradigms in english because english has grammatical agreement rules that require the verb in a sentence to appear in an inflectional form that matches the person and number of the subject in other words the syntactic rules of english care about the difference between dog and dogs because it 
determines which form of the verb must be used but in contrast no syntactic rule of english cares about the difference between dog and dog catcher or dependent and independent the first two are just nouns and the second two just adjectives and they generally behave like any other noun or adjective behaves the major difference between inflection and word formation is that inflectional forms of <UNK> are organized into paradigms which are defined by the requirements of syntactic rules the part of morphology that covers the relationship between syntax and morphology is called <UNK> and it concerns itself with inflection and paradigms but not with word formation or compounding <UNK> and <UNK> in the exposition above morphological rules are described as analogies between word forms dog is to dogs as cat is to cats and as dish is to dishes in this case the analogy applies both to the meaning of the words and to their forms in each pair the word in the left always means one of x and the one on the right many of x and at the distinction is always signaled by having the plural form have an s at the end which the singular does not have one of the largest sources of complexity in morphology is that this sort of one to one correspondence between meaning and form hardly ever holds in english we have word form pairs like ox oxen goose geese and sheep sheep where the difference between the singular and the plural is signaled in a different way from the regular pattern or not signalled at all even the case we consider regular with the final s is not quite that simple the s in dogs is not pronounced the same way as the s in cats and in a plural like dishes we have an extra vowel before the s these cases where the same distinction is effected by different changes of form for different <UNK> are called <UNK> there are several kinds of <UNK> one is pure <UNK> where the <UNK> are just arbitrary the most extreme cases here are called <UNK> where two forms related by a morphological rule are just arbitrarily different for example the past of go is went which is a <UNK> form on the other hand other kinds of <UNK> are due to interaction between morphology and phonology phonological rules constrain which sounds can appear next to each other in a language and morphological rules when applied <UNK> would often violate phonological rules by resulting in impossible sound sequences for example if we were to try to form the plural of dish by just putting a s at the end we d get <UNK> which is not permitted by the phonology to rescue the word we put a vowel sound in between and get dishes similar rules apply to the pronunciation of the s in dogs and cats it depends on the quality voiced vs <UNK> of the preceding phoneme the study of <UNK> that results from the interaction of morphology and phonology is called <UNK> many <UNK> rules fall under the category of <UNK> lexical morphology lexical morphology is the branch of morphology that deals with the lexicon which morphologically conceived is the collection of <UNK> in a language as such it concerns itself primarily with word formation derivation and compounding models of morphology there are three major families of approaches to morphology which try to capture the distinctions above in different ways these are morpheme based morphology which makes use of an item and arrangement approach lexeme based morphology which normally makes use of an item and process approach word based morphology which normally makes use of a word and paradigm approach please note that while the associations indicated between the concepts in each item in that list is very strong it is not absolute morpheme based morphology in morpheme based morphology word forms are analyzed as sequences of morphemes a morpheme is defined as the minimal meaningful unit of a language in a word like independently we say that the morphemes are in depend <UNK> and ly depend is the root and the other morphemes are in this case <UNK> affixes in a word like dogs we say that dog is the root and that s is an inflectional morpheme this way of analyzing word forms as if they were made of morphemes put after each other like beads on a string is called item and arrangement the morpheme based approach is the first one that beginners to morphology usually think of and which laymen tend to find the most obvious this is so to such an extent that very often beginners think that morphemes are an inevitable fundamental notion of morphology and many five minute explanations of morphology are in fact five minute explanations of morpheme based morphology this is however not so the fundamental idea of morphology is that the words of a language are related to each other by different kinds of rules analyzing words as sequences of morphemes is a way of describing these relations but is not the only way in actual academic linguistics morpheme based morphology certainly has many adherents but is by no means absolutely dominant applying a morpheme based model strictly quickly leads to complications when one tries to analyze many forms of <UNK> for example it s easy to think that in dogs we have the root dog followed by the plural morpheme s the same sort of analysis is also straightforward for oxen with the stem ox and a <UNK> plural morpheme en but then how do we split up the word geese into root plural morpheme how do we do so for sheep theorists who wish to maintain a strict morpheme based approach often preserve the idea in cases like these by saying that geese is goose followed by a null morpheme a morpheme that has no phonological content and that the vowel change in the stem is 
a <UNK> rule it is also common for morpheme based analyses to posit null morphemes even in the absence of any <UNK> for example if the plural noun dogs is analyzed as a root dog followed by a plural morpheme s then one might analyze the singular dog as the root dog followed by a null morpheme for the singular lexeme based morphology lexeme based morphology is usually an item and process approach instead of analyzing a word form as a set of morphemes arranged in sequence we think of a word form as the result of applying rules that alter a word form or stems to produce a new one an inflectional rule takes a stem does some changes to it and outputs a word form a <UNK> rule takes a stem and outputs a derived stem a compounding rule takes word forms and outputs a compound stem the item and process approach bypasses the difficulty described above for item and arrangement approaches faced with a plural like geese we don t have to assume there is a zero morph all we say is that while the plural of dog is formed by adding an s to the end the plural of goose is formed by changing the vowel in the stem word based morphology word based morphology is a usually word and paradigm approach this kind of theory takes paradigms as a central notion instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word forms or to generate word forms from stems word based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms the major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches the examples are usually drawn from <UNK> languages where a given piece of a word which a morpheme based theory would call an inflectional morpheme corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories for example third person plural morpheme based theories usually have no problems with this situation since one just says that a given morpheme has two categories item and process theories on the other hand often break down in cases like these because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here one for third person and the other for plural but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial word and paradigm approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by <UNK> rules words can be categorized based on the pattern that they fit into this applies both to existing words and to new ones application of a different pattern than the one that was used historically can give rise to a new word such as older replacing elder where older follows the normal pattern of adjectival <UNK> and cows replacing <UNK> where cows fits the regular pattern of plural formation while a word and paradigm approach can explain this easily other approaches have difficulty with phenomena such as this morphological typology see the main article morphological typology in the one nine th century philologists devised a now classic classification of languages in terms of their morphology according to this typology some languages are isolating and have little or no morphology others are agglutinative and their words tend to have lots of easily separable morphemes while yet others are <UNK> because their inflectional morphemes are said to be fused together the classic example of an isolating language is chinese the classic example of an agglutinative language is turkish both latin and greek are classic examples of <UNK> languages when one considers the variability of the world s languages it becomes clear that this classification is not at all clear cut and many languages don t neatly fit any one of these types however examined against the light of the three general models of morphology described above it is also clear that the classification is very much biased towards a morpheme based conception of morphology it makes direct use of the notion of morpheme in the definition of agglutinative and <UNK> languages it describes the latter as having separate morphemes fused together which often does correspond to the history of the language but not to its <UNK> reality the three models of morphology stem from attempts to analyze languages that more or less match different categories in this typology the item and arrangement approach fits very naturally with agglutinative languages while the item and process and word and paradigm approaches usually address <UNK> languages the reader should also note that the classical typology also mostly applies to inflectional morphology there is very little fusion going on with word formation languages may be classified as synthetic or analytic in their word formation depending on the preferred way of expressing notions that are not inflectional either by using word formation synthetic or by using syntactic phrases analytic footnotes the existence of words like appendix and pending in english does not mean that the english word depend is analyzed into a <UNK> prefix de and a root <UNK> while all those were indeed once related to each other by morphological rules this was so only in latin not in english english borrowed the words from french and latin but not the morphological rules that allowed latin speakers to combine de and the verb <UNK> hang into the derivative <UNK> see also <UNK> bound morpheme dependent marking language head marking language inflected language

macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs above the level of species in contrast microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes generally described as changes in genotype frequencies in populations that in the modern synthesis of evolutionary thought are the normal mode of evolution thus the process of speciation is the link between macroevolution and microevolution and it can fall within the <UNK> of either paleontology evolutionary developmental biology and comparative genomics contribute most of the evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution macroevolution is controversial in two ways it is disputed among biologists whether there are <UNK> processes that are not described by classical population genetics this view is becoming less and less <UNK> as the role for genome wide changes and developmental processes in evolution become clearer a misunderstanding about this biological controversy has allowed the concept of macroevolution to be <UNK> by creationists they use this controversy as a supposed hole in the evidence for deep time evolution research topics some examples of subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution the debate between punctuated equilibrium and <UNK> speciation and extinction rates mass extinctions adaptive <UNK> such as the the cambrian explosion changes in biodiversity through time the role of development in shaping evolution particularly such topics as <UNK> and developmental <UNK> genomic evolution like horizontal gene transfer genome <UNK> in <UNK> and adaptive changes in genome size creationism though the details of macroevolution are debated within the scientific community it is widely accepted macroevolution is largely disputed by many creationism and intelligent design advocates generally speaking these groups differentiate between microevolution and macroevolution asserting that the former is an undeniably observable phenomena but that the latter is not they have proposed a number of limits beyond which they assert evolution cannot occur proponents of intelligent design argue that the mechanisms of evolution are incapable of giving rise to instances of specified complexity and irreducible complexity proponents of creation biology assert that life was originally created in a finite number of discrete created kinds beyond which and between which no evolution can occur the argument being that the dominant source of biological change is population isolation genetic drift and mutation which causes the loss of the diversity of the original kinds and genetic information rather than an increase of genetic diversity through mutation or other evolutionary mechanisms history of macroevolution the debate over the relationship between macroevolution and microevolution has been going on since the one eight six zero s when evolution first became a widely accepted idea following the publication of charles darwin s the origin of species the first theory of macroevolution <UNK> developed by biologist jean baptiste lamarck asserted that individuals develop traits they use and lose traits they do not use and that individuals pass the acquired traits onto their offspring lamarck asserted that when environmental changes changed the needs of a species which caused it to develop different traits leading to the transmutation of species gregor mendel an austrian monk popularly known as the father of 
modern genetics for his discovery of the laws of genetic variation in his study of natural variation in plants believed that the laws of inheritance provided no grounds for macroevolution in a lecture on march eight one eight six five mendel noted that his research described the mechanism of microevolution but gave no grounds for belief in macroevolution saying no one will seriously maintain that in the open country the development of plants is ruled by other laws than in the garden bed here as there changes of type must take place if the conditions of life be altered and the species possesses the capacity of fitting itself to its new environment however nothing justifies the assumption that the tendency to form varieties increases so extraordinarily that the species speedily lose all stability and their offspring diverge into an endless series of extremely variable forms to the contrary he said the tendency is toward stability with variation being the exception not the rule <UNK> one four one darwin on the other hand saw no fundamental difference between microevolution and macroevolution he asserted that certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub species that is the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to but do not quite arrive at the rank of species or again between subspecies and well marked varieties or between lesser varieties and individual differences these differences blend into each other by an <UNK> series and a series <UNK> the mind with the idea of an actual passage darwin seven seven although mendel s laws of inheritance were published as early as one eight six six his theory was generally overlooked until the early twentieth century in part because it was published in an obscure journal and by someone from outside the mainstream scientific community darwin himself never read of mendel s work and his own proposed mechanism for inherited traits <UNK> was more useful for statisticians of the <UNK> school than it was for biologists darwin had discovered a variation ratio of two four one in a study of <UNK> which he published in one eight six eight similar to the three one ratio that led mendel to discover the laws of genetic variation however darwin was not sure of its ultimate meaning <UNK> one four three after the rediscovery of mendel s laws in one nine zero zero the statisticians and biologists argued against each other until they were reconciled by the work of r a fisher in the one nine three zero s in the late one nine three zero s evolutionary biologist theodosius <UNK> devised the modern evolutionary synthesis in bringing macroevolution and microevolution to the english language wrote we are compelled at the present level of knowledge reluctantly to put a sign of equality between the mechanisms of macro and microevolution <UNK> one two some have argued that he was reluctant to equate macro and microevolution because it went against the beliefs of his mentor <UNK> who was an <UNK> and of the opinion that micro and macroevolution were of a different mechanism and calibre <UNK> one nine nine four from the writings of <UNK> the modern synthesis view of evolution grew to its present prominence with the discovery of the structure of dna and genes genetic mutation gained acceptance as the mechanism of variance in the one nine six zero s this developing theory of evolution was then called the modern evolutionary synthesis which remains prominent today the synthetic model of evolution equated microevolution and macroevolution asserting that the only difference between them was one of time and scale a few non darwinian evolutionists remained however including <UNK> and <UNK> who argued that the processes of macroevolution are different from those of microevolution according to these scientists macroevolution occurs but is restricted by such proposed mechanisms as developmental constraints the concept can be summarized in <UNK> s law which holds that when organisms are living within their normal range of environment perturbations in the conditions of life and most genetic differences between individuals have little or no effect on their manifest physiology and development but that under severe and unusual general stress conditions even small environmental and genetic differences have major effects non darwinian evolution points to evidence of great changes in population under conditions of stress however it is generally rejected by the scientific community because it provides no mechanism for larger changes at a genetic level under those circumstances for a discussion of <UNK> s theory of <UNK> see this article in the late one nine seven zero s stephen j gould challenged the synthesis model of evolution and proposed a punctuated equilibrium model whereby major evolutionary changes took place in limited gene pools after radical climate changes he said i well remember how the synthetic theory of evolution <UNK> me with its unifying power when i was a graduate student in the mid one nine six zero s since then i have been watching it slowly <UNK> as a universal

theory is now enjoying this uncommon vigor yet amidst all this turmoil no biologist has been led to doubt the fact that evolution occurred we are debating how it happened we are all trying to explain

encyclopedia <UNK> near freiburg with his mother originating from <UNK> and studied at the university in freiburg in one five zero seven working at saint di des <UNK> in lorraine he produced a world globe and a large world map universalis <UNK> bearing the first use of the name america the globe and map were accompanied by a book <UNK> <UNK> an introduction to <UNK> the book includes a translation to latin of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> four voyages of amerigo which is apparently a letter written by amerigo vespucci although some historians consider it to have been a forgery written by its supposed recipient in italy the <UNK> describes why the name america was used ab americo <UNK> quasi <UNK> <UNK> sive <UNK> from amerigo the discoverer as if it were the land of <UNK> thus america some hold that the <UNK> was written by matthias <UNK> instead or that it was a joint effort in one five one three <UNK> ller appears to have had second thoughts about the name probably due to contemporary protests about vespucci s role in the discovery and naming of america in his reworking of the ptolemy atlas written with <UNK> the continent is labelled simply terra <UNK> unknown land however one zero zero zero copies of the world map had been distributed and the original suggestion took hold while north america was still called indies in documents for some time it was eventually called america as well the map was lost for a long time but a copy was found in a castle at <UNK> in southern germany by joseph fischer in one nine zero one it is still the only copy known in existence and was purchased by the library of congress in two zero zero one four copies of the globe survive in the form of <UNK> printed maps that were intended to be cut out and <UNK> on to a ball only one of these lies in the americas residing at the university of minnesota the mystery of the pacific <UNK> ller s one five zero seven map is intriguing for another reason related to its naming of america as a new continent it depicts north and south america astonishingly accurately as two large continents joined or nearly so by a narrow isthmus with mountainous western coasts and a great ocean beyond separating them from asia however the first european to set eyes on this ocean the pacific was vasco n ez de balboa in one five one three six years after <UNK> ller made his map until this time it was still erroneously believed that the lands discovered by columbus vespucci et al formed part of asia and the indies thus there seems to be no way that <UNK> ller could have known about the pacific the historian peter whitfield has theorised that <UNK> ller incorporated the ocean into his map because vespucci s accounts of the americas with their savage peoples could not be reconciled with contemporary knowledge of china and the indies thus <UNK> ller reasoned the newly discovered lands could not be part of asia but must be separate from it a leap of intuition that was later proved

one nine eight three disbanded in two zero zero two and reformed in two zero zero four history the early years shortly after lead guitarist dave mustaine was fired from metallica due to alcohol problems and personality conflicts mustaine and bassist david <UNK> formed megadeth as mustaine himself says i could only focus on one thing after being kicked out of metallica i wanted blood theirs after searching for a vocalist and not finding what he wanted mustaine became the band s singer and primary lyricist as well as the main songwriter and lead guitarist the band soon added jazz fusion drummer gar <UNK> and guitarist kerry king of slayer fame king was only a temporary member covering a handful of live dates he was replaced later the same year by chris poland a friend of gar s the debut line up in late one nine eight four they were signed to combat records and in may one nine eight five they released their first album entitled killing is my business and business is good the band had been <UNK> eight zero zero zero to record and produce the album but spending half of that budget on drugs the sound quality left much to be desired the band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album themselves even with its somewhat poor production megadeth s debut was a well received album that blended elements of 
thrash speed metal and punk rock in november one nine eight six they released their second album peace sells but who s buying which is regarded by many critics as megadeth s finest hour and a ground breaking thrash metal album better production and more sophisticated songwriting earned megadeth immense respect and cemented their place alongside metallica slayer and anthrax in the big four of thrash later that same year megadeth signed with capitol records who also bought the rights to peace sells from combat gar <UNK> and chris poland were fired from the band after the final show of a hawaiian tour amidst rumors of drug abuse by the entire band mustaine claimed that <UNK> had become too much to handle when intoxicated and that poland had been selling band equipment to fund his drug habit because of this mustaine wrote the song liar and dedicated it to poland the replacements were chuck <UNK> on drums and jeff young on guitars so far so good so what in march one nine eight eight the new line up released their next album so far so good so what the album although a commercial success was widely panned by critics who complained that the album sounded stale and was inconsistent a cover of the sex pistols anarchy in the uk polarized fans with some enjoying it and others seeing as indicative of the entire album s failure the band appeared in penelope <UNK> one nine eight eight documentary the decline of western civilization ii the metal years the video for in my darkest hour inspired by the death of metallica bassist cliff burton was filmed by <UNK> and used in the movie also the band was interviewed including mustaine talking about not wanting to be a <UNK> and chuck discussing that he doesn t do drugs an <UNK> for the movie in which mustaine claims glam stands for gay la music appears on the megadeth episode of behind the music on megadeth s <UNK> pieces vhs mustaine and <UNK> discuss the movie as a disappointment which paired them with shit bands the lineup that had recorded so far so good so what was short lived as chuck and jeff were fired in one nine eight eight dave mustaine on the vhs of the decline of western civilization ii the metal years nick <UNK> was hired to replace <UNK> on the drums and the group recorded a cover of alice cooper s no more mr nice guy the only song ever recorded by megadeth as a trio mustaine held <UNK> for many guitarists one of them being the late darrell abbott <UNK> darrell whom mustaine liked but did not hire because abbott would not play without his brother <UNK> paul playing drums and mustaine had just hired <UNK> marty friedman who had played in <UNK> with jason becker was initially ruled out by mustaine for having two tone hair but was eventually hired to replace young on lead guitar the rust in peace era the mustaine <UNK> friedman and <UNK> line up became the most stable and successful of megadeth s career recording four well received albums and created megadeth s reputation as a band that could not only play metal well but also create more commercially acceptable offerings in one nine nine zero megadeth showed no sign of weakening the band s fourth album rust in peace is still regarded by many to be one of if not the most technically sophisticated and exciting speed thrash metal album ever released singles for hangar one eight and holy wars the punishment due were successful as megadeth s characteristically caustic and catchy lyrics and raw fast thrash metal riffs were finally captured with a clear and precise production which allowed all the nuances of mustaine s guitar compositions to be heard rust in peace showcased a level of technical complexity akin to progressive metal the band s first home video <UNK> pieces was released in one nine nine one and showcased all the music videos up to that point in between the videos the band was interviewed with reflections on the career and the introduction of nick and marty to the band in july one nine nine two megadeth released the album countdown to extinction it became an instant hit reached two on the billboard album charts and went multi platinum mustaine himself said that he measured his future successes against those of countdown the album featured noticeably simpler song structures catchy melodic hooks and an increased emphasis on the singer s voice megadeth however successfully integrated these changes into their typical cynical ironic and heavily political lyrical themes the song architecture of aggression features the sound of cnn and abc reporters <UNK> watching and commenting on the opening shots of the gulf war and <UNK> of a dream a song discussing the recession and its particular effect on american agriculture has the infamous read my lips promise of george h w bush under the pressure from the u s congress this promise was later to be broken of not raising taxes arguably the album was megadeth s first true attempt at breaking into the mainstream rock market in which they had never gained a major foothold mustaine and the rest of the band members were frustrated however that billy ray cyrus kept them out of billboard s number one spot with <UNK> <UNK> heart and although they were nominated for a grammy nine inch nails took home the award for wish the band released their second home video exposure of a dream in one nine nine three the video featured all the music videos from countdown as well as the video for go to hell this video was a part two of the band s music videos continuing in a similar to fashion to <UNK> pieces the following album <UNK> was delivered in one nine nine four and it also became a great success continuing the new direction indicated by countdown to 
extinction <UNK> featured a still more relaxed sound and generally slower songs slower than some older fans could tolerate the unusual beats per minute bpm parity on the album is attributed to producer max norman who apparently made megadeth use around one two zero bpm on every song in order to try and make megadeth s music more acceptable to rock radio this led to some backlash from long term fans and the sell out term was starting to show up the band s recording experience for <UNK> was captured for <UNK> the making of <UNK> in which the building of the recording studio recording mixing artwork and photography was explained dave mustaine starred in this video as a teacher explaining the recording process to elementary school children this was to become the band s third home video and included the music video for train of <UNK> cryptic writings and risk their next album entitled cryptic writings was released in one nine nine seven this album had more pop influences than the previous ones but its sound was still <UNK> megadeth s nick <UNK> had left due to an injury in one nine nine eight and replaced by jimmy <UNK> a drummer mustaine had worked with on his md four five project in one nine nine nine computer game development company three d realms announced that they would be using various unreleased megadeth tracks on their promotional album duke nukem music to score by megadeth also recorded a rendition of the famous duke nukem theme song <UNK> originally composed by lee jackson the pop influences were even more evident on the following album one nine nine nine s risk which suffered from <UNK> sales and poor response from critics and fans alike shortly after its release marty friedman left the band and was replaced by al <UNK> formerly of <UNK> looking for a way to end their contract with capitol records the band released a greatest hits collection entitled capitol punishment the megadeth years two zero zero zero this compilation included two new tracks kill the king and dread and the fugitive mind that the band was <UNK> obligated to give to capitol from capitol to sanctuary the world needs a hero lineup circa two zero zero one from left to right al <UNK> lead recipe for hate <UNK> and burning bridges still many felt that it fell short of their expectations for the band and mustaine himself likened the album to the first major turn of a huge ship at sea trying to right itself and get back on course the band toured for the album in two zero zero one and finished up with a couple of concerts in arizona which were recorded and released as a double disc live album and dvd called rude awakening originally the live album dvd was to be recorded in argentina but those dates were cancelled due the september one one two zero zero one attacks on the u s a the world without megadeth on april three two zero zero two mustaine announced in a press release that he was leaving the band officially due to an injury that caused nerve damage to his left arm he was diagnosed with radial neuropathy that was induced by falling asleep with his arm over the back of a chair causing compression of the radial <UNK> nerve a devastating injury for any musician this seemed to mark the end of the band s nearly twenty year career megadeth returns sans three members gradually physical therapy helped mustaine s arm heal though he admits he had to <UNK> much of his guitar playing skill after writing his first consciously solo album and <UNK> the reissue of megadeth s catalogue remixed and remastered he enlisted the help of <UNK> <UNK> on drums chris poland who had played with megadeth in the one nine eight zero s on lead guitar and session musician jimmy <UNK> on bass to record his new album originally titled blackmail the universe but later renamed the system has failed two zero zero four due to pressure from his record label he was forced to change this from a solo album to the final megadeth album owed to sanctuary as dave mustaine said megadeth is slowly rising from the ashes mustaine then contacted all the members of the rust in peace lineup to offer them a spot on a tour to promote the new album nick <UNK> was <UNK> as the drummer but mustaine could not reach agreement with <UNK> or friedman early july of two zero zero four saw the entire the system has failed album leaked onto the internet mustaine is said to have been deeply upset by this but the scheduled release date of september two zero zero four was maintained the system has failed made its debut at one eight on the billboard charts and received overall positive reviews from critics hailed as a return to megadeth s golden days of the late eight zero s and early nine zero s at the same time <UNK> filed an one eight five million lawsuit in the new york federal court against mustaine and the band claiming he was entitled to a greater share of the band s profits in january two zero zero five the federal court dismissed the case finding that <UNK> had released his claims in a may two zero zero four settlement agreement with the band mustaine and the band filed a counter suit against <UNK> in the california state court for breach of the settlement agreement that suit eventually was settled shortly following the release of the system has failed mustaine appointed glen <UNK> formerly of king diamond and <UNK> as megadeth s new guitarist additional line up changes were james <UNK> formerly of iced earth on bass and shawn <UNK> the brother of glen <UNK> on drums shawn <UNK> was hired to be megadeth drummer five days before the first show of the blackmail the 
universe tour apparently because <UNK> was no longer capable of playing megadeth songs the blackmail the universe world tour running from late two zero zero four until late two zero zero five with a staggered touring schedule proved to be a true comeback and return to form for megadeth and their first large scale tour for several years previously mustaine had also announced that it was the final megadeth tour and that the band would be disbanding immediately afterwards however as of march two zero zero five dave mustaine announced <UNK> megadeth s largest tour ever in july two zero zero five the band released a greatest hits record entitled back to the start greatest hits megadeth s most recent lineup from left to right glen <UNK> lead and rhythm guitars dave mustaine lead vocals lead rhythm megadeth will continue as a band megadeth will record a new album megadeth will continue to play mustaine during a concert in argentina in two zero zero five following his first mention of the continuation of the band mentioned that he has been working with his current bandmates the <UNK> and <UNK> on writing the next megadeth album this was also confirmed by mustaine during a megadeth concert in puerto rico on october one five two zero zero five six days after the one in argentina the answer is yes on february one zero th two zero zero six james <UNK> announced he was leaving the band for as of yet unexplained reasons although there are rumors he was going to rejoin his former band iced earth mustaine said that he would let <UNK> rejoin the band if he wanted to and claims to be over feuds with <UNK> and metallica for that matter on february one two th two zero zero six james <UNK> was hired as the new bass player laying the rumors of <UNK> s return to rest mustaine has also said a bunch of times in the past that he would like to see him <UNK> hetfield and ulrich team up in order to revive their particular magic in thrash metal many fans of one band are usually also fans of the other and tend to be enthusiastic of the idea lyrical themes aside from megadeth s unmistakable guitar style there are several recurring lyrical themes across their albums war and military themes particularly nuclear war as in set the world <UNK> originally titled megadeth is a common theme for many of the band s songs in fact the band s name is a play on the word <UNK> a term coined by the us military to mean one million deaths however beyond nuclear war topics for megadeth songs include the military industrial complex architecture of aggression hangar one eight the aftermath of war ashes in your mouth and sectarian violence holy wars the punishment due the video clip for in my darkest hour was banned from mtv as it was interpreted to have been written about suicide though it was written as a tribute to cliff burton a theme which arose more blatantly in skin o my teeth and a tout le monde politics is also a common theme to many megadeth songs mustaine is scathing in his assessment of <UNK> gore the <UNK> and music censorship in the song hook in mouth attacks gambling in train of consequences takes an environmentalist stance in countdown to extinction and <UNK> dictators in songs like <UNK> symphony of destruction and ashes in your mouth mustaine s general cynicism about politics shines through on tracks like peace sells but who s buying and the world needs a hero blackmail the universe includes an alex jones <UNK> while megadeth has recorded songs about relationships they tend to be songs either about breaking up or have a dark twist trust almost honest addicted to chaos and one zero zero zero times goodbye are examples of the former examples of the latter include promises an eerie ballad from beyond the grave and loved to <UNK> a song about a man who is angry that he can t have the woman he loves and seeks to kill her the one exception to this was the risk track i ll be there and is often held up as an example of what was wrong with that particular album s pop rock influences a few of megadeth s songs feature references to marvel characters such as the <UNK> in both the punishment due second part of holy wars the punishment due and killing is my business and business is good and <UNK> in <UNK> controversy in may two zero zero five during preparation for the band s <UNK> festival dave mustaine threatened to cancel non related shows in greece with rotting christ and israel with dissection which in turn caused the two black metal bands to cancel their appearances both groups supposed lyrical subject matter past or present and mustaine s identification as a born again christian was said to be the reason however skepticism had arisen about actual intentions since megadeth had upcoming tours scheduled with other bands of a <UNK> or semi <UNK> nature including another gig with dissection and because many of megadeth s vintage songs had questioned the institutions of organized religion yet more lineup changes in february two zero zero six one day out of the blue bass player james <UNK> announced on the megadeth bulletin board that he would no longer be playing for megadeth <UNK> and wanting answers megadeth

legendary king of crete son of zeus and europa the minoan civilization has been named after him by his wife <UNK> he was the father of ariadne <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> glaucus <UNK> and many others minos along with his brothers <UNK> and <UNK> was raised by king <UNK> or <UNK> of crete when <UNK> died he gave his throne to minos who banished <UNK> and according to some sources <UNK> too it is not clear if minos is a name or if it was the cretan word for king scholars have noted the interesting similarity between minos and the names of other ancient founder kings such as <UNK> of egypt <UNK> of germany manu of india and so on the historical and scholarly minos he reigned over crete and the islands of the aegean sea three generations before the trojan war he lived at knossos for periods of nine years at the end of which he retired into a sacred cave where he received instruction from zeus in the legislation which he gave to the island this included the establishment of pederasty as a means of population control on the island community they segregated the women and instituted sexual relations among the males so that women would not have children aristotle politics ii one zero he was the author of the cretan constitution and the founder of its naval supremacy herodotus three one two two thucydides one four in attic tradition and on the athenian stage minos is a cruel tyrant the <UNK> <UNK> of the tribute of athenian youths to feed the minotaur it seems possible that tribute children were actually <UNK> to take part in the gruesome shows of the minoan bull rings of which we now have more than one illustration to reconcile the contradictory aspects of his character as well as to explain how minos governed crete over a period spanning so many generations two kings of the name of minos were assumed by later poets and <UNK> according to this view the first king minos was the son of zeus and europa and brother of <UNK> and <UNK> this was the good king minos and he was held in such esteem by the olympian gods that after he died he was made one of the three judges of the dead alongside his brother <UNK> and half brother aeacus the wife of this minos minos i was said to be <UNK> daughter of <UNK> or crete a nymph or daughter of his stepfather <UNK> and he had a single son named <UNK> his successor as king of crete <UNK> had a son named minos after his grandfather born by <UNK> s wife ida daughter of <UNK> this second minos the bad king minos is the son of this 
<UNK> and was a far more colorful character than his father and grandfather it is to this minos minos ii that we owe the myths of theseus <UNK> the minotaur daedalus glaucus and <UNK> unlike minos i minos ii fathered numerous children including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ariadne <UNK> and glaucus all born to him by his wife <UNK> he was the grandfather of king <UNK> who led the cretans to the trojan war since phoenician intercourse was in later times supposed to have played an important part in the development of crete minos is sometimes called a phoenician there is no doubt that there is a considerable historical element in the legend recent discoveries in crete prove the existence of a civilization such as the legends imply and render it probable that not only athens but mycenae itself was once subject to the kings of <UNK> of whom minos was greatest in view of the splendour and wide influence of minoan crete the age generally known as mycenaean has been given the name of minoan by dr arthur evans as more properly descriptive minos himself is said to have died at <UNK> in sicily <UNK> he had gone in pursuit of daedalus who had given ariadne the clue by which she guided theseus through the labyrinth he was killed by the daughter of <UNK> king of agrigentum who poured boiling water over him while he was taking a bath diodorus siculus four seven nine subsequently his remains were sent back to the cretans who placed them in a sarcophagus on which was inscribed the tomb of minos the son of zeus the earlier legend knows minos as a beneficent ruler <UNK> and suppressor of piracy thucydides one four his constitution was said to have formed the basis of that of <UNK> pausanias three two four in accordance with this after his death he became judge of the shades in the under world odyssey nine five six eight later he was associated with aeacus and <UNK> the solar explanation of minos as the sun god has been thrown into the background by the recent discoveries in any case a divine origin would naturally be claimed for him as a priest king and a divine atmosphere hangs about him the name of his wife <UNK> the all shining is an epithet of the moon goddess the name minos seems to be <UNK> the equivalent of <UNK> the royal ancestor of the <UNK> of <UNK> and his daughter ariadne the exceeding holy is a double of the native nature goddess minos in art on cretan coins minos is represented as bearded wearing a diadem curly haired <UNK> and dignified like the traditional portraits of his reputed father zeus on painted vases and sarcophagus bas reliefs he frequently occurs with aeacus and <UNK> as judges of the under world and in connection with the minotaur and theseus the mythological minos miletus <UNK> king of crete adopted the three sons of zeus and europa minos <UNK> and <UNK> in adulthood the three brothers <UNK> over a beautiful boy they were all in love with by the name of miletus mythology son of apollo and <UNK> the youth however preferred <UNK> so minos in revenge went to war and conquered the whole island <UNK> and his boyfriend escaped to lycia where miletus founded the city that bore his name other mythographers claimed that the beloved youth s name was <UNK> and that he was the son of zeus and cassiopeia apollodorus iii one two bernard <UNK> claims that the story is a late invention in that the theme of competition for a beloved youth is not in keeping with the cretan pederastic tradition and there is no record of this miletus prior to the second century bce glaucus one day glaucus was playing with a ball or mouse and suddenly disappeared his parents went to the oracle at delphi who told them a marvelous creature has been born amongst you whoever finds the true likeness for this creature will also find the child they interpreted this to refer to a newborn calf in minos herd three times a day the calf changed color from white to red to black <UNK> observed the similarity to the ripening of the fruit of the <UNK> plant and minos sent him to search for glaucus searching for glaucus <UNK> saw an owl driving bees away from a wine cellar in minos palace inside the wine cellar was a cask of honey with glaucus dead inside minos demanded glaucus be brought back to life though <UNK> objected as minos <UNK> his son s corpse a snake appeared nearby <UNK> killed it with minos sword another snake came for the first and after seeing the dead snake the second serpent left and brought back an herb which then brought the first snake back to life following this example <UNK> used the same herb to resurrect glaucus minos refused to let <UNK> leave crete until he taught glaucus everything he knew <UNK> did so but then at the last second before leaving he asked glaucus to spit in his mouth glaucus did so giving <UNK> back everything he had been taught poseidon daedalus and <UNK> minos was challenged as king and prayed to poseidon for help poseidon sent a giant white bull out of the sea minos planned on sacrificing the bull to poseidon but then decided not to he substituted a different bull in rage poseidon cursed <UNK> minos wife with <UNK> daedalus built her a wooden cow which she hid inside the bull mated with the wooden cow and <UNK> was impregnated by the bull giving birth to a horrible monster the minotaur daedalus then built a complicated maze called the labyrinth and minos put the minotaur in it to make sure no one would ever know the secret of the labyrinth minos imprisoned daedalus and his son icarus in a tower daedalus and icarus flew away on wings daedalus invented 
but icarus wings melted because he flew too close to the sun icarus fell in the sea and drowned theseus some time later minos son <UNK> won every game in a contest to <UNK> of athens alternatively the other contestants were jealous of <UNK> and killed him minos was angry and declared war on athens he offered the athenians peace if they sent minos seven young men and seven virgin maidens to feed the minotaur every nine years which corresponded directly to the <UNK> meticulous records of lunar <UNK> a full moon falls on the equinoxes once every eight years this continued until theseus killed the minotaur with the help of ariadne minos <UNK> daughter <UNK> in his <UNK> xiii six zero one f recounts a version of the tale in the love of minos for theseus is the reason for his giving up his war against the athenians <UNK> minos was also part of the king <UNK> story <UNK> was king of megara and he was invincible as long as a lock of red hair still existed hidden in his white hair minos attacked megara but <UNK> knew he could not be beaten because he still had his lock of red hair his daughter scylla fell in love with minos and proved it by cutting the red hair off her father s head <UNK> died and megara fell to crete minos killed scylla for <UNK> her father she was changed into a <UNK> relentlessly pursued by her father who was a sea eagle the death of minos minos searched for daedalus by travelling from city to city asking a riddle he presented a spiral <UNK> and asked for it to be strung all the way through when he reached <UNK> sicily king <UNK> knowing daedalus would be able to solve the riddle fetched the old man he tied the string to an ant which walked through the <UNK> stringing it all the way through minos then knew daedalus was in the court of king <UNK> and demanded he be handed over <UNK> managed to convince him to take a bath first <UNK> daughters then killed minos by burning him with boiling water after his death minos became a judge of the dead in hades together with aeacus and <UNK> <UNK> judged the souls of asians aeacus judged europeans and minos had the deciding vote in poetry in the aeneid of virgil minos was the judge of those who had

convention foreword html measurement systems of units in computer networking a media access control address mac address is a unique identifier attached to most forms of networking equipment most layer two network protocols use one of three numbering spaces managed by the ieee mac four eight <UNK> four eight and <UNK> six four which are designed to be globally unique not all communications protocols use mac addresses and not all protocols which do require such globally 
unique identifiers the ieee claims trademarks on the names <UNK> four eight and <UNK> six four the <UNK> stands for extended unique identifier arp <UNK> is commonly used to map the layer two mac address to an address in a layer three protocol such as internet protocol ip on broadcast networks such as ethernet the mac address allows each host to be uniquely identified and allows frames to be marked for specific hosts it thus forms the basis of most of the layer two networking upon which higher osi layer protocols are built to produce complex functioning networks address details the original ieee eight zero two mac address now officially called mac four eight comes from the ethernet specification since the original designers of ethernet had the foresight to use a four eight bit address space there are potentially two four eight or two eight one four seven four nine seven six seven one zero six five six possible mac addresses all three numbering systems use the same format and differ only in the length of the identifier the first three octets in transmission order identify the organization which issued the identifier and are known as the <UNK> unique identifier <UNK> the following three mac four eight and <UNK> four eight or five <UNK> six four octets are assigned by that organization in nearly any manner they please subject to the constraint of uniqueness the ieee expects the mac four eight space to be exhausted no sooner than the year two one zero zero <UNK> six four s are not expected to run out in the foreseeable future mac addresses permanently attached to a product by the manufacturer are known as burned in addresses bia or sometimes as universally administered addresses <UNK> the bia can be <UNK> with a locally administered address <UNK> mac four eight and <UNK> four eight addresses are usually shown in hexadecimal format with each octet separated by a dash or colon an example of a mac four eight address would be zero zero zero eight seven four four c seven f one d if you cross reference the first three octets with ieee s <UNK> assignments you can see that this mac address came from dell computer corp the last three octets represents the serial number assigned to the adapter by the manufacturer the following technologies use the mac four eight identifier format ethernet token ring eight zero two one one wireless networks bluetooth <UNK> atm switched virtual connections only as part of an <UNK> address scsi and fibre channel as part of a world wide name the distinction between <UNK> four eight and mac four eight identifiers is purely semantic mac four eight is used for network hardware <UNK> four eight is used to identify other sorts of devices and software thus by definition an <UNK> four eight is not in fact a mac address although it is syntactically indistinguishable from one and assigned from the same numbering space note the ieee now considers the label mac four eight to be an obsolete term which was previously used to refer to a specific type of <UNK> four eight identifier used to address hardware interfaces within existing eight zero two based networking applications and should not be used in the future instead the term <UNK> four eight should be used by manufacturers and others in the field for this purpose <UNK> six four identifiers are used in firewire ipv six as the low order six four bits of a unicast network address when temporary addresses are not being used the ieee has built in several special address types to allow more than one network interface card to be addressed at one time the broadcast address all one bits is received by all stations on a local area network in hexadecimal this would be ff ff ff ff ff ff multicast addresses used with both ethernet and <UNK> are received by stations on a lan which have been configured to do so multicast addresses have the least significant bit of their first octet set to one value zero one in printed format locally administered addresses are assigned by the network administrator instead of the hardware vendor locally administered addresses have the second bit of their first octet set to one value zero two in printed format functional addresses identify one of more token ring <UNK> that provide a particular service defined in ieee eight zero two five in addition the <UNK> six four numbering system encompasses both mac four eight and <UNK> four eight identifiers by a simple translation mechanism to convert a mac four eight into an <UNK> six four copy the <UNK> append the two octets ff ff and then copy the organization specified part to convert an <UNK> four eight into an <UNK> six four the same process is used but the sequence inserted is ff fe in both cases the process can be trivially reversed when necessary organizations issuing <UNK> six four s are cautioned against issuing identifiers which would be confused with these forms the ieee s policy is to discourage new uses of four eight bit identifiers in favor of the <UNK> six four system confusingly ipv six one of the most prominent standards that uses <UNK> six four applies these rules <UNK> due to an error in the appendix to the specification of ipv six addressing it is currently standard practice in ipv six to extend mac four eight addresses such as ieee eight zero two mac address to <UNK> six four using ff fe rather than ff ff it remains to be seen how this inconsistency will be resolved in the future printed format the standard ieee eight zero two format for printing mac four eight addresses in human readable media is six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by <UNK> in transmission order e g zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ab this form is also commonly used for <UNK> six four other 
conventions include six groups of two separated by <UNK> e g zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ab or three groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by dots e g zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ab again in transmission order changing mac addresses although physical mac addresses are permanent by design several mechanisms allow modification or spoofing of the mac address that is reported by the operating system this can be useful for privacy reasons for instance when connecting to a wi fi hotspot or to ensure interoperability some internet service providers bind their service to a specific mac address if the user then changes their network card or intends to install a router the service won t work anymore changing the mac address of the new interface will solve the problem similarly some software licenses are bound to a specific mac address changing the mac address in this way is not permanent after a reboot it will revert to the mac address physically stored in the card as a mac address can be changed it can be unwise to rely on this as a single method of authentication ieee eight zero two one x is an emerging standard better suited to <UNK> devices at a low level linux under linux the mac address of a network interface card nic can be changed by doing the following you must be root in order for this to work etc <UNK> d

he calls him levi two one four some explain this discrepancy by saying he formerly was known as levi but then he changed it possibly in grateful memory of his call to matthew the same day on which jesus called him he made a great feast luke five two nine a farewell feast to which he invited jesus and his disciples and probably also many of his old associates the last notice of him in the new testament is in acts one one three he is one of the few disciples mentioned by name in the apocryphal gospel of thomas suggesting he was of more importance in the early church than surviving evidence

cartridge based system and portability would surely be a success in the first year eight million was grossed making smith engineering a million dollar industry but very few cartridges a small screen and no backing up by a conventional console lead to its demise in one nine eight one <UNK> units and cartridges are very rare nowadays time is taking its toll on the <UNK> units still in existence there are three main problems faced by <UNK> owners screen rot <UNK> damage and keypad destruction the manufacturing process used to create the <UNK> s lcd was primitive by today s standards poor sealing and impurities introduced during manufacture has resulted in a condition known as screen rot the liquid crystal spontaneously leaks and permanently <UNK> resulting in a game unit that still plays but is unable to properly draw the screen while extreme heat such as resulting from leaving the unit in the sun can instantly destroy the screen there is nothing that can be done to prevent screen rot in most <UNK> a major design problem involves the fact that the microprocessor which is inside the top of each cartridge lacks <UNK> protection and is directly connected to the copper pins which normally connect the cartridge to the <UNK> unit if the user opens the protective sliding door that covers the pins the processor can be exposed to any electric charge the user has built up if the user has built up a substantial charge the discharge can jump around the door s edge or pass through the door itself dielectric breakdown the low voltage ic inside the cartridge is extremely <UNK> sensitive and can be destroyed by an event of only a few dozen volts which cannot even be felt by the person delivering the fatal shock instead of having buttons on a separate controller the <UNK> unit had a twelve button keypad with the switches buried under a thick layer of flexible plastic to align the user s fingers with the hidden buttons the cartridges had <UNK> in their bottom over the keypad as different games required different button functions the <UNK> were covered with a thin printed piece of plastic which identified the buttons functions in that game the problem with this design is that pressing on the buttons stretched the printed plastic resulting in the thin material stretching and eventually tearing having long fingernails exacerbated the condition the first <UNK>

the video signal either physically recorded directly on the tape as with vhs or created on playback by a chip in the player as with dvds ntsc and other video formats store the video signal as lines a portion of these lines are used for constructing the visible image by <UNK> them on the screen but there are approximately two zero to four zero lines outside the visible range that are used for different things in different countries like closed <UNK> <UNK> inserts pulses into this non displayed area these signals cause the automatic gain control on the recording vcr to compensate for the varying strength this makes the recorded picture wildly change brightness rendering it <UNK> on most televisions the viewer on the screen sees no effect in ordinary playback of the protected video because the signal is outside the visible area but some tvs do not properly blank the vertical <UNK> and leave dotted white lines near the top of the picture some newer tvs also mistake the <UNK>

of the united states machine code or machine language is a system of instructions and data directly understandable by a computer s central processing unit machine code instructions the words of a machine language are called instructions each of which cause an elementary action by the cpu such as reading from a memory location instructions are patterns of bits with different patterns corresponding to different commands to the machine every cpu model has its own machine code or instruction set although there is considerable overlap between some if cpu a understands the full language of cpu b it is said that a is compatible with b cpu b may not be compatible with cpu a as a may know a few codes that b does not some machine languages give all their instructions the same number of bits while the instruction length differs in others how the patterns are organised depends largely on the specification of the machine code common to most is the division of an instruction into fields typically the value of one field the opcode specifies the exact operation for example add other fields may give the type of the operands their location or their value directly operands contained in an instruction are called immediate some exotic instruction sets do not have an opcode field such as transport triggered architectures or the forth virtual machine only operand s other instruction sets lack any operand fields such as <UNK> no operand stack computers programs a program is a sequence of instructions that are executed by a cpu while simple processors execute instructions one after the other superscalar processors are capable of executing several instructions at once program flow may be influenced by special jump instructions that transfer execution to an instruction other than the following one conditional jumps are taken execution continues at another address or not execution continues at the next instruction depending on some condition assembly languages humans use mnemonic codes to refer to machine code instructions such a more readable rendition of the machine language is called an assembly language and consists of both binary numbers and simple words whereas machine code is composed only of the two binary digits zero and one for example on the zilog z eight zero processor the machine code zero zero zero zero zero one zero one causes the cpu to decrement the b processor register in assembly language this would be written as dec b example the mips architecture provides a specific example for a machine code whose instructions are always three two bits long the general type of instruction is given by the op operation field the highest six bits j type jump and i type immediate instructions are fully specified by op r type register instructions include an additional field <UNK> to determine the exact operation the fields used in these types are six five five five five six bits op rs rt rd <UNK> <UNK> r type op rs rt

languages machine code instructions per second ips is a measure of a computer s processor speed many reported ips values have represented peak execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches whereas realistic workloads consist of a mix of instructions and even applications some of which take longer to execute than others the performance of the memory hierarchy also greatly affects processor performance an issue barely considered in mips calculations because of these problems researchers created standardized tests such as <UNK> to maybe measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications and raw ips has fallen into disuse the term is commonly used in association with a numeric value such as thousand instructions per second <UNK> or million instructions per second mips thousand instructions per second a thousand instructions per second <UNK> is rarely used as most current microprocessors can execute several million instructions per second the thousand means one zero zero zero not one zero two four <UNK> is also a common joke name for one six bit microprocessor designs developed in undergraduate computer engineering courses that

opportunities in set theory and its applications throughout mathematics a class is a collection of sets or sometimes other mathematical objects that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share some classes are sets for instance the class of all integers that are even but others are not for instance the class of all ordinal numbers or the class of all sets a class that is not a set is called a proper class a proper class cannot be an element of a set or a class and is not subject to the zermelo fraenkel axioms of set theory thereby a number of paradoxes of naive set theory are avoided instead these paradoxes become proofs that a certain class is proper for example russell s paradox becomes a proof that the class of all sets is proper and the burali <UNK> paradox becomes a proof that the class of all ordinal numbers is proper the standard zermelo fraenkel set theory axioms do not talk about classes classes exist only in the <UNK> as equivalence classes of logical formulas another approach is taken by the von neumann <UNK> g del axioms classes are the basic objects in this theory and a set is then defined to be a class that is an element of some other class the proper classes then are those classes that are not elements of any other class several objects in mathematics are too big for sets and need to be described with classes for instance large categories or the class field of surreal numbers in other set theories such as new foundations or the theory of <UNK> the concept of proper class still makes sense not all collections are sets but the criterion of <UNK> is not size for example any set theory with a universal set has proper classes which are subclasses of sets the word class is sometimes used synonymously with set most notably in the term equivalence class this usage dates from a historical period where classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern terminology many discussions of classes in the one nine th

said the torah did not drop down as a package from heaven but is an ongoing relationship with the people of israel it is a product of many generations of reflection on what is meant by god s word while jacobs found that statement to be compatible with orthodox judaism the chief rabbi condemned his views as denial of the divine origin of the torah jacobs was rejected for the <UNK> of the jews

official publications as being one of the movement s founders in one nine zero nine kaplan joined the staff at jts where he had his greatest impact by teaching conservative jewish rabbinic and jewish education students over a five zero year period his central idea of understanding judaism as a religious civilization was accepted within conservative judaism but his naturalistic conception of god was not as accepted his view of god and rejection of the concept of jews as a chosen people led to him being excluded by the orthodox in one nine six eight his followers induced him to formally leave conservative judaism and set up the reconstructionist rabbinical college <UNK> in which his philosophy reconstructionist judaism would be promoted as a separate religious denomination kaplan s theology rabbi mordecai kaplan s theology held that in light of the advances in philosophy science and history it would be impossible for modern jews to continue to adhere to many of judaism s traditional theological claims kaplan s naturalistic theology has been seen as a variant of john dewey s philosophy dewey s naturalism combined atheist beliefs with religious terminology in order to construct a religiously satisfying philosophy for those who had lost faith in traditional religion kaplan was also influenced by mile durkheim s argument that our experience of the sacred is a function of social solidarity in agreement with the classical medieval jewish thinkers kaplan affirmed that god is not personal and that all anthropomorphic descriptions of god are at best imperfect metaphors kaplan s theology went beyond this to claim that god is the sum of all natural processes that allow man to become self fulfilled kaplan wrote that to believe in god means to take for granted that it is man s destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society it should be noted that not all of kaplan s writings on the subject were consistent his position evolved somewhat over the years and two distinct theologies can be discerned with a careful reading the view more popularly associated with kaplan is strict naturalism la dewey which has been criticised as using religious terminology to mask a non theistic if not outright atheistic position however a second strand of <UNK> theology exists which makes clear that at times kaplan believed that god has ontological reality a real and absolute existence independent of human beliefs in this latter theology kaplan still rejects classical forms of theism and any belief in

technology is not the same company as <UNK> company history a better six eight zero zero than the six eight zero zero mos originally started up to provide a second source for texas instruments designed electronic calculators and 
the chips inside them they also produced atari s custom pong chip for a short time as the calculator market grew mos eventually became largely <UNK> to commodore international then commodore business machines who bought practically all of their supply for their line of calculators things changed dramatically in one nine seven five several of the designers of the motorola six eight zero zero left the company shortly after its release apparently in disgust at the time there was no such thing as a design only firm known as a <UNK> semiconductor company today so they had to join a chip building company to produce any of their designs mos was a small firm with good credentials in the right area the east coast of the usa the team of four design engineers was headed by chuck <UNK> and included bill <UNK> at mos they set about building a new cpu that would <UNK> the six eight zero zero while being similar to it in purpose the resulting six five zero one design was somewhat similar to the six eight zero zero but by using several simplifications in the design the six five zero one would be up to four times faster lowering the costs by mask fixing in addition mos had a secret weapon the ability to fix its masks masks are the large drawings of the chip that are photo reduced to make the pattern from which chips are made a process similar to <UNK> all masks end up with flaws both as a result of design problems in the chip itself as well as side effects from the photo reduction process when a chip is made with this mask there is a chance that some of these flaws will end up expressed on the chip if too many of them are expressed that chip will not work if a chip design with five flaws results in a mask with ten flaws there is no point in making another because it will have the same five design flaws plus some other set of five copying flaws so companies simply built chips with these masks and threw away broken chips at the time in the one nine seven zero s this meant throwing away seven zero or more of the completed chips the price of a chip is largely defined by the yield the measure of how many work so improving this number can lower the price and raise the gross profit dramatically mos s engineers had learned the trick of fixing their masks after they were made this allowed them to correct the major flaws in a series of small fixes eventually producing a mask with a very low flaw rate the company s production lines typically reversed the numbers others were achieving even the early runs of a new cpu design what would become the six five zero two were achieving a success rate of seven zero or better this meant that not only were its designs faster they cost much less as well the six five zero two family makes its mark when the six five zero one was announced motorola launched a lawsuit almost immediately although the six five zero one was not compatible with the six eight zero zero it could nevertheless be plugged into existing motherboard designs because it used the same arrangement of pins that was enough apparently to allow motorola to sue sales of the six five zero one basically stopped and the lawsuit would drag on for many years before mos was eventually forced to pay a <UNK> two zero zero zero zero zero in fines in the meantime the six five zero two had gone on sale at one mhz in september one nine seven five for a mere two five due to its speed it <UNK> the more complex and expensive six eight zero zero intel eight zero eight zero and zilog z eight zero series but cost much less and was easier to work with although it did not have the advantage of being able to be used in existing motorola hardware like the six five zero one it was so inexpensive that it quickly overran the six eight zero zero in popularity anyway making that a moot point image of the <UNK> of a commodore six four showing some important mos technology circuits the six five one zero cpu long chip lower left and the six five eight one sid right the production week year <UNK> of each chip is given below its name in fact the cpu was so cheap that many people believed it to be scam when the company first showed the six five zero two at a one nine seven five trade show they were not aware of mos s masking techniques and when they calculated the price per chip at normal yield rates it did not add up but any hesitation to buy it evaporated when both motorola and intel dropped the prices on their own designs from one seven nine to six nine at the same show in order to compete their moves legitimized the six five zero two and by the end of the show all the samples were gone the six five zero two would quickly go on to be one of the most popular chips of its day a number of companies licensed the six five zero x line from mos including rockwell international gte <UNK> and western design center <UNK> a number of different versions of the basic cpu known as the six five zero three through six five zero seven were offered in two eight pin packages for lower cost the various models removed signal or address pins far and away the most popular of these was the six five zero seven which was used in the atari two six zero zero and in atari disk drives the six five zero four was sometimes used in printers mos also released a series of similar cpus 
using external clocks which added a one to the name in the three rd digit as the six five one two through six five one five these were useful in systems where the clock support was already being provided on the motherboard by some other chip the final addition was the crossover six five one zero used in the commodore six four with additional i o ports commodore semiconductor group however successful the six five zero two was the company itself was having problems at about the time the cpu was released the entire calculator market collapsed and mos s only existing products stopped shipping soon they were in serious financial trouble rescue came in the form of commodore who bought the entire company in a stock trade on the condition that chuck <UNK> would join commodore as chief engineer the deal went through and while the firm basically became commodore s production arm they continued using the name mos for some time so that manuals would not have to be reprinted after a while mos became the commodore semiconductor group <UNK> despite being renamed to <UNK> all chips produced were still stamped with the old mos logo until one nine eight nine mos had previously designed a simple computer kit called the kim one primarily to show off the six five zero two chip at commodore <UNK> convinced the owner jack tramiel that calculators were a dead end and that home computers would soon be huge a repackaged kim with a new display driver and keyboard became the commodore pet computer however the original design group appeared to be even less interested in working for jack tramiel than it had for motorola and the team quickly started breaking up one result was that the newly completed six five two two via chip was left undocumented for years bill <UNK> left mos even before the commodore takeover and moved home to mesa az from mos s <UNK> pa after a short stint consulting for a local company called ice he set up the western design center <UNK> in one nine seven eight as a licensee of the six five zero two line their first products were bug fixed power efficient cmos versions of the six five zero two the six five c zero two both as a separate chip and embedded inside a microcontroller called the six five c one five zero but then they expanded the line greatly with the introduction of the six five eight one six a fairly straightforward one six bit upgrade of the original six five c zero two that could also run in eight bit mode for compatibility the design of the similar in concept three two bit six five eight three two cpu was completed but

sanger september one four one eight seven nine september six one nine six six was an american birth control activist an advocate of certain aspects of eugenics and the founder of the american birth control league which eventually became planned parenthood initially meeting with fierce opposition to her ideas sanger gradually won the support of the public and the courts for a woman s right to decide how and when she will bear children though her selective support of eugenics was less well received margaret sanger was instrumental in opening the way to universal access to birth control life sanger was born in <UNK> new york her mother was a devout roman catholic who went through one eight pregnancies with one one live births before dying of tuberculosis after graduating from <UNK> college in hudson sanger trained as a nurse and worked for ten years in the affluent new york suburb of white plains in one nine zero two she married william sanger although stricken by tuberculosis she gave birth to a son the following year followed in subsequent years by a second son and a daughter who died in childhood in one nine one two sanger and her family moved to new york city where she went to work in the poverty stricken east side slums of manhattan that same year she also started writing a column for the new york call entitled what every girl should know distributing a pamphlet family limitation to poor women sanger repeatedly risked scandal and imprisonment by acting in defiance of the <UNK> law of one eight seven three which outlawed as obscene the dissemination of contraceptive information and devices in one nine one four sanger launched the woman rebel a newspaper advocating birth control she also separated from william sanger in one nine one three in one nine one six sanger opened a family planning and birth control clinic in the <UNK> neighborhood of brooklyn the first of its kind in the united states it was raided by the police and sanger was arrested for violating the post office s obscenity laws by sending birth control information by mail sanger fled to europe to escape prosecution there she had an affair with the famous science fiction author h g wells the following year she returned to the u s and resumed her activities launching the periodical the birth control review and birth control news she also contributed articles on health for the socialist party paper the call in one nine one six sanger published what every girl should know which was later widely distributed as one of the e <UNK> julius little blue books it not only provided basic information about such topics as menstruation but also acknowledged the reality of sexual feelings in adolescents it was followed in one nine one seven by what every mother should know that year sanger was sent to the <UNK> for creating a public nuisance sanger founded the american birth control league <UNK> in one nine two one with <UNK> <UNK> and c c little in one nine two two she traveled to japan to work with japanese feminist kato <UNK> promoting birth control over the next several years she would return another six times for this purpose in this year she also married oil tycoon james noah h <UNK> in one nine two three under the auspices of the <UNK> she established the clinical research bureau it was the first legal birth control clinic in the u s renamed margaret sanger research bureau in her honor in one nine four zero that year she also formed the national committee on federal legislation for birth control and served as its president of until its dissolution in one nine three seven after birth control under medical supervision was legalized in many states in one nine two seven sanger helped organize the first world population conference in geneva in one nine two eight sanger resigned as the president of the <UNK> two years later she became president of the birth control international information center in one nine three seven sanger became chairperson of the birth control council of america and launched two publications the birth control review and the birth control news from one nine three nine to one nine four two she was an honorary delegate of the birth control federation of america from one nine five two to one nine five nine she served as president of the international planned parenthood federation at the time the largest private 
international family planning organization during the one nine six zero presidential elections sanger was dismayed by candidate john f kennedy s position on birth control though a catholic kennedy did not believe birth control should be a matter of government policy she threatened to leave the country if kennedy were elected but evidently reconsidered after kennedy won the election in the early one nine six zero s sanger promoted the use of the newly available birth control pill she toured europe africa and asia lecturing and helping to establish clinics sanger died in one nine six six in tucson arizona at age eight seven only a few months after the landmark griswold v connecticut decision which legalized birth control for married couples in the us it was the apex of her fifty year struggle sanger s books include woman and the new race one nine two zero happiness in marriage one nine two six and an autobiography one nine three eight philosophy although sanger was greatly influenced by her father a <UNK> her mother s death left her with a deep sense of dissatisfaction concerning her own and society s medical ignorance she also criticized the censorship of her reproductive literacy message by the civil and religious authorities justified on moral grounds as an effort by men to keep women in submission an atheist sanger attacked the christian faith for its opposition to her message blaming it for <UNK> and insensitivity to women s concerns sanger was particularly critical of the lack of awareness of the dangers of and the scarcity of treatment opportunities for venereal disease among women she claimed that these social ills were the result of the male establishment s intentionally keeping women in ignorance sanger also <UNK> the contemporary absence of regulations requiring registration of people diagnosed with venereal diseases which she contrasted with mandatory registration of those with infectious diseases such as measles sanger was also an avowed socialist blaming the evils of contemporary capitalism for the unsatisfactory conditions of the young working class women her views on this issue are evident in the last pages of what every girl should know psychology of sexuality while sanger s understanding of and practical approach to human physiology were progressive for her times her thoughts on the psychology of human sexuality place her squarely in the pre freudian one nine th century birth control it would appear was for her more a means to limit the undesirable side effects of sex than a way of liberating men and women to enjoy it in what every girl should know she wrote every normal man and woman has the power to control and direct his sexual impulse men and woman who have it in control and constantly use their brain cells thinking deeply are never sensual sexuality for her was a kind of weakness and <UNK> it indicated strength though sex cells are placed in a part of the anatomy for the essential purpose of easily expelling them into the female for the purpose of reproduction there are other elements in the sexual fluid which are the essence of blood nerve brain and muscle when redirected in to the building and strengthening of these we find men or women of the greatest endurance greatest magnetic power a girl can waste her creative powers by brooding over a love affair to the extent of exhausting her system with the results not unlike the effects of masturbation and debauchery her thoughts on human development were also laden with racism it is said that a fish as large as a man has a brain no larger than the kernel of an almond in all fish and reptiles where there is no great brain development there is also no conscious sexual control the lower down in the scale of human development we go the less sexual control we find it is said that the aboriginal australian the lowest known species of the human family just a step higher than the chimpanzee in brain development has so little sexual control that police authority alone prevents him from obtaining sexual satisfaction on the streets sanger also considered masturbation dangerous in my experience as a trained nurse while attending persons afflicted with various and often <UNK> diseases no matter what their ailments i have never found any one so repulsive as the chronic <UNK> it would be difficult not to fill page upon page of <UNK> confessions made by young girls whose lives were <UNK> by this <UNK> habit always begun so <UNK> for even after they have ceased the habit they find themselves incapable of any relief in the natural act perhaps the greatest physical danger to the chronic <UNK> is the inability to perform the sexual act naturally for her masturbation was not just a physical act it was a mental state in the boy or girl past puberty we find one of the most dangerous forms of masturbation i e mental masturbation which consists of forming mental pictures or thinking obscene or <UNK> pictures this form is considered especially harmful to the brain for the habit becomes so fixed that it is almost impossible to free the thoughts from <UNK> pictures eugenics sanger found supporters among believers in eugenics a social philosophy ultimately embraced in nazism that led to the rise of such practices as compulsory sterilization to discourage unsuitable persons from breeding in the name of perfecting the human race in one nine three two for example sanger argued for a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring certain <UNK> groups in our population she continued should be given their choice of segregation or sterilization while considered enlightened in some circles at the time today such measures would be regarded as violations of human rights and yet in the birth control review of february one nine one nine 
she clarified her position <UNK> imply or insist that a woman s first duty is to the state we contend that her duty to herself is her first duty to the state we maintain that a woman possessing an adequate knowledge of her reproductive functions is the best judge of the time and conditions under which her child should be brought into the world we further maintain that it is her right regardless of all other considerations to determine whether she shall bear children or not and how many children she shall bear if she chooses to become a mother in a mix of socialist and eugenic thought sanger blamed economic factors involved in choice of spouse for contributing to <UNK> human reproduction and argued for more assertive public health and eugenics measures sanger s writings often make use of the loaded terms <UNK> <UNK> and feeble minded which were then used to refer to individuals affected by mental retardation or the <UNK> disabled the later use of these terms as <UNK> has put them out of favor and diluted their original meaning in the context of eugenics the terms did not refer to physically and mentally normal people who were disadvantaged or considered by other groups to be inferior with advances in biology and genetics it has become clear that at least some of the negative eugenic policies sanger advocated to prevent the feeble minded from reproducing would in practice be ineffective for example it is now known that down syndrome is for the most part not heritable legacy sanger remains a controversial figure while she is widely credited as a leader of the modern birth control movement and remains an iconic figure for the american reproductive rights movements she also is reviled by some who condemn her as an abortion advocate perhaps unfairly so abortion was illegal during sanger s lifetime and planned parenthood did not then support the procedure or lobby for its <UNK> or those who disagree in principle with eugenics groups opposed to planned parenthood and or legalized abortion have frequently targeted sanger for her views attributing her efforts to promote birth control to a desire to purify the human race through eugenics and even to eliminate minority races by placing birth control clinics in minority neighborhoods for this reason sanger is often quoted selectively or out of context by detractors a practice known as quote mining and her history and involvement with socialism and eugenics have often been rationalized or even ignored by her defenders and biographers a practice known as spin <UNK> despite the allegations of racism sanger s work with minorities earned the respect of civil rights leaders such as martin luther king jr in their biographical article about margaret sanger planned parenthood notes in one nine three zero sanger opened a family planning clinic in harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city s health and social services staffed by a black physician and black social worker the clinic was endorsed by the amsterdam news the powerful local newspaper the abyssinian baptist church the urban league and the black community s elder statesman w e b dubois although sanger s views on abortion like many of her opinions changed throughout the course of her life in her early years she was acutely aware of the problem of abortion typically self induced or with the aid of a midwife her opposition to abortion stemmed primarily from a concern for the dangers to the mother and less so from legal concerns or the welfare of the unborn child she wrote in a one nine one six edition of family limitation no one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable though she framed this in the context of her birth control advocacy adding that abortions will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception care is the only cure for abortions sanger consistently regarded birth control and abortion as the responsibility and burden first and foremost of women and as matters of law medicine and public policy second e texts the pivot of civilization what every girl should know

husband and first cousin william iii who became the sole ruler upon her death popular histories usually know the joint reign as that of william and mary mary although a sovereign in her own right did not wield power during most of her reign she did however govern the realm when her husband was abroad fighting wars early life mary born in london was the eldest daughter of james duke of york the future james ii of england and of his first wife the lady anne hyde mary s uncle was king charles ii her maternal grandfather edward hyde one st earl of clarendon served for a lengthy period as

as the heiress to the english crown and feared that she would become more powerful than he was mary however convinced her husband that she cared not for political power william agreed to invade his intentions became public knowledge by september one six eight eight and the dutch army landed on five november the english people s confidence in james stood so low that they did not attempt to save

summoned by the prince of orange assembled and much discussion relating to the appropriate course of action ensued william of orange felt insecure about his position he wished to reign as a king rather than function as a mere consort of a queen the only precedent for a joint monarchy dated from the sixteenth century when queen mary i married the spanish prince philip it was agreed that the latter would take the title of king but philip ii remained king only during his wife s lifetime and restrictions were placed on his power william however demanded that he remain king even after his wife s death although some prominent statesmen proposed to make her the sole ruler mary remaining loyal to her husband refused on one three february one six eight nine parliament passed the declaration of right in which it deemed that james by attempting to flee on one one december one six eight eight had abdicated the government of the realm and that the throne had thereby become vacant parliament offered the crown not to james s eldest son james francis edward who would have been the heir apparent under normal circumstances but to william and mary as joint sovereigns it was however

standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent deny the right to bear arms to protestant subjects unduly interfere with parliamentary elections punish members of either house of parliament for anything said during debates require excessive bail or inflict cruel or unusual punishments the bill of rights also addressed the question of succession to the throne following the

one five five eight one six zero three mary tudor was a first cousin once removed of mary queen of scots early life mary was the second daughter and fifth child of henry viii and his first wife

one six she was baptised on the following thursday with thomas cardinal <UNK> standing as her godfather the princess mary was a precocious but sickly child who had poor eyesight sinus conditions and bad headaches her poor health has been theorised by some authors to be from congenital syphilis transferred to her from her mother who presumably would have contracted the disease from mary s father whether or not he had the disease is debated however as the story emerged long after his death henry gave the princess mary her own court at ludlow castle and many of the prerogatives normally only given to a prince of wales sometimes leading to false assertions that she was created princess of wales even though he was deeply disappointed that he or as he believed his wife had again failed to produce a healthy son catherine s sixth and last child was a stillborn daughter the princess mary became an extremely well educated child under the direction of her governess the countess of salisbury she learned to speak latin spanish french and 
italian as well as her native english other studies included greek science and music in july one five two zero when scarcely four and a half years old she entertained some visitors with a performance on the virginals a smaller harpsichord a great part of the credit of her early education was undoubtedly due to her mother who not only consulted the spanish scholar juan lu s <UNK> upon the subject but was herself the princess mary s first teacher in latin even when she was a young child the princess mary s marital future was being negotiated by her father when she was but two years old she was promised to the dauphin francis son of francis i king of france after three years the contract was repudiated in one five two two the princess mary was instead contracted to her first cousin the holy roman emperor charles v by the treaty of windsor within a few years however the engagement was broken off in one five two six the princess mary was sent to wales to preside over the council of wales and the marches it was then suggested that the princess mary wed not the dauphin but his father francis i who was eager for an alliance with england a marriage treaty was signed it provided that the princess mary should marry either francis or his second son henry duke of orl ans cardinal <UNK> henry viii s chief advisor managed to secure an alliance without a marriage meanwhile the marriage of the princess mary s parents was in jeopardy queen catherine had failed to provide henry the male heir he desired consequently the king attempted to have his marriage to her annulled in one five three

valid since the pope had previously denied him the <UNK> henry broke with the roman catholic church all appeals from the decisions of english ecclesiastical courts to the pope were abolished mary meanwhile was deemed illegitimate as henry s marriage to catherine was officially null and void from the beginning she lost the dignity of a princess becoming a mere lady her place in the line of succession was transferred to the princess elizabeth daughter of queen anne the lady mary was expelled from the royal court her servants were dismissed from her service and she was forced to serve as a lady in waiting under the queen anne s aunt the lady shelton to her own infant half sister elizabeth then living in hatfield she was not permitted to see her mother catherine or attend her funeral in one five three six her treatment and the hatred queen anne had for her was perceived as unjust all europe furthermore regarded her as the only true heir and daughter of henry viii although she was illegitimate under english law mary confidently expected her troubles to end when queen anne lost royal favour and was beheaded in one five three six the princess elizabeth was also degraded to a lady and removed from the line of succession henry married jane seymour who died shortly after giving birth to a son the prince edward duke of cornwall the lady mary s privy purse expenses for nearly the whole of this period have been published and show that hatfield beaulieu or <UNK> in essex richmond and <UNK> were among her principal places of residence the princess mary one five four four however it quickly <UNK> that it had been mary s father henry not anne alone who had been persecuting mary the only way he would grant her his favor was if she accepted humiliating attacks on her religion and royal position the lady mary attempted to reconcile with her father by submitting to him as head of the church of england under jesus thus <UNK> papal authority and acknowledging that the marriage between her mother and father was unlawful thus making her illegitimate she also became <UNK> to her half brother edward and was chief mourner at queen jane s funeral in turn henry agreed to grant her a household and the lady mary was permitted to reside in royal palaces henry s sixth and last wife catherine parr was able to bring the family closer together again improving the lady mary s position there were several attempts to marry her off to european princes but none of them succeeded in one five four four henry through an act of parliament returned the lady mary and the lady elizabeth to the line of succession after their half brother the prince edward duke of cornwall both women however remained legally illegitimate in one five four seven henry died to be succeeded by edward vi edward was england s first protestant monarch his parliament s act of uniformity prescribed protestant rites for church services such as the use of thomas cranmer s new book of common prayer the lady mary <UNK> of maintaining the old roman catholic form asked to be allowed to worship in private in her own chapel after she was ordered to stop her practices she appealed to her cousin and former <UNK> prospect the emperor charles v charles threatened war with england if the lady mary s religious liberty were infringed consequently the protestants at court ceased to interfere with her private rituals accession edward vi did not desire that the crown go to either the lady mary or the lady elizabeth consequently he excluded them from the line of succession in his will which was unlawful because it contradicted an act of parliament passed in one five four four restoring the lady mary and the lady elizabeth to the line of succession and because it was made by a minor under the guidance of john dudley one st duke of northumberland edward vi instead devised the crown to the lady jane 
grey a descendant of henry viii s younger sister thus after edward died on six july one five five three the lady jane grey was proclaimed queen jane s accession was met with popular disapproval which was suppressed by the use of force a young boy so bold as to hail queen mary was punished by having his ears cut off still the country remained devoted to mary on one nine july jane s accession proclamation was deemed to have been made under coercion and was revoked instead mary was proclaimed queen all support for the lady jane vanished and mary rode into london triumphantly and unchallenged with her half sister the lady elizabeth at her side on three august since the act of succession passed in one five four four recognised only mary as edward s heir and since edward s will was never authorised by statute mary s de jure reign dates to six july one five five three the date of edward s death her de facto reign however dates to one nine july one five five three when jane was deposed one of her first actions as monarch was to order the release of the catholic thomas howard three rd duke of norfolk and stephen gardiner from imprisonment in the tower of london originally mary was inclined to exercise clemency and initially set the lady jane grey free recognising that the young girl was forced to take the crown by her father in law the lady jane s father henry grey one st duke of suffolk was also released the duke of northumberland was the only conspirator immediately executed for high treason and even this was after some hesitation on the queen s part she was left in a difficult position as almost all the privy counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put the lady jane grey on the throne she could only rely on stephen gardiner whom she appointed bishop of winchester and lord chancellor gardiner performed mary s coronation on one october one five five three because mary did not wish to be crowned by the senior ecclesiastics who were all protestants reign mary s first act of parliament retroactively validated henry viii s marriage to catherine of aragon and <UNK> the queen now three seven mary turned her attention to <UNK> a husband to father an heir in order to prevent her half sister the lady elizabeth from succeeding to the throne she rejected edward courtenay one st earl of devon as a prospect when her first cousin the holy roman emperor charles v suggested that she marry his only son the spanish prince philip the marriage a purely political alliance for philip who strongly disliked her was extremely unpopular with the english lord chancellor gardiner and the house of commons petitioned her to consider marrying an englishman fearing that england would be relegated to a dependency of spain the fear of dependency was due in large part to the inexperience of having a queen <UNK> insurrections broke out across the country when she refused the duke of suffolk once again proclaimed that his daughter the lady jane grey was queen the young sir thomas wyatt led a force from kent and was not defeated until he had arrived at london s gates after the rebellions were crushed both the duke of suffolk and the lady jane grey were convicted of high treason and executed since the rebellion was designed to put her on the throne the lady elizabeth was imprisoned in the tower of london but was put under house arrest in woodstock palace after two months mary and philip appear on the above medal by jacopo da <UNK> made circa one five five five mary married philip on two five july one five five four at winchester cathedral under the terms of the marriage treaty philip was to be styled king of england all official documents including acts of parliament were to be dated with both their names and parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple philip s powers however were extremely limited he and mary were not true joint sovereigns nonetheless philip was the only man to take the crown <UNK> upon his marriage to a reigning queen of england william iii became jointly sovereign with his wife mary ii pursuant to act of parliament rather than <UNK> right coins were to also show the head of both mary and philip the marriage treaty further provided that england would not be obliged to provide military support to philip s father the holy roman emperor in any war mary fell in love with philip and thinking she was pregnant had thanksgiving services at the diocese of london in november one five five four but philip found his queen who was eleven years his senior to be physically unattractive and after only fourteen months left for spain under a false excuse mary suffered a phantom pregnancy philip released the lady elizabeth from house arrest so that he could be viewed favourably by her in case mary died during childbirth mary then turned her attention to religious issues she had always rejected the break with rome instituted by her father her half brother edward had established protestantism mary wished to revert to roman catholicism england was reconciled with rome and reginald cardinal pole who would become an adviser mary very heavily depended upon became archbishop of canterbury after mary had his predecessor executed edward s religious laws were abolished by mary s first parliament and numerous protestant leaders were executed in the so called marian persecutions the first to die were john rogers four february one five five five laurence saunders eight february one five five five rowland taylor nine february one five five five and john hooper the bishop of gloucester nine february one five five five the persecution lasted uninterrupted for three and three quarter years she earned the epithet of bloody mary though 
her successor and half sister elizabeth more than balanced the number killed under mary with catholic persecution in total but not in frequency elizabeth reigned seven times as long and some of her executions were of actual traitors under any definition for frequency the persecution of catholics under the short reign of her predecessor edward vi is perhaps more comparable or possibly the persecution of protestants in the early years of their father henry viii having inherited the throne of spain upon his father s abdication philip returned to england from march to july one five five seven to persuade mary to join with spain in a war against france in the italian wars meanwhile england was full of faction and seditious pamphlets of protestant origin <UNK> the people with hatred against the spaniards but perhaps the <UNK> thing about the situation was that pope paul iv sided with france against spain english forces fared badly in the conflict and as a result the kingdom lost calais its last remaining continental possession mary later lamented that when she lay dead the words philip and calais would be found inscribed on her heart mary persuaded parliament to repeal the protestant religious laws passed by edward and henry before her but it took several years to persuade parliament to go all the way and to get their agreement she had to make a major concession tens of thousands of acres of monastery lands confiscated under henry were not returned to the monasteries the new group of landowners that had been set up by this distribution remained very influential mary also set in motion currency reform to counteract the dramatic devaluation of the currency overseen by thomas gresham that characterized the last few years of henry viii s reign and the reign of edward vi these measures however were largely unsuccessful and it was only under elizabeth that economic catastrophe was prevented mary s deep religious convictions also inspired her to institute social reforms although these were unsuccessful as well under her reign in another of the plantations of ireland english colonists were settled in the irish midlands to reduce the attacks on the pale the colony around dublin two counties were created and in her honour were named queens county and for phillip kings county the county town of queens county was called <UNK> death during her reign mary s weak health led her to suffer numerous phantom pregnancies after such a delusion in one five five eight mary decreed in her will that her husband philip should be the regent during the minority of her child no child however was born and mary died at the age of forty two of influenza uterine cancer or ovarian cancer at st james s palace on one seven november one five five eight it has been theorised that an ovarian <UNK> prevented her from becoming pregnant she was succeeded by her half sister who became elizabeth i mary was interred in westminster abbey on one four december in a tomb she would eventually share with queen elizabeth the latin inscription on a marble plaque on their tomb affixed there during the reign of king james i translates to partners both in throne and grave here rest we two sisters elizabeth and mary in the hope of one resurrection legacy although mary enjoyed tremendous popular support and sympathy for her mistreatment during the earliest parts of her reign she lost almost all of it after marrying philip the english viewed the marriage as a breach of english independence they felt that it would make england a mere dependency of spain the marriage treaty clearly specified that england was not to be drawn into any spanish wars but this guarantee proved meaningless philip spent most of his time governing his spanish and european territories and little of it with his wife in england after mary s death philip became a <UNK> for elizabeth s hand but elizabeth refused during the five year long reign two eight three individuals were burnt at the stake twice as many as had suffered the same fate during the previous century and a half of english history and at a greater rate than under the contemporary spanish inquisition several notable clerics were

on february four but had continued to act as secretary of state until jefferson was inaugurated on march three marshall became chief justice and swore in jefferson jefferson treated as void two five of the four two commissions approved on inauguration day including <UNK> s because they had not been officially delivered by day s end some scholars have suggested that it was actually an attempt to reduce expenses by cutting judicial salaries jefferson appointed james madison as the new secretary and ordered him not to deliver the <UNK> commission at this point in the country s history the supreme court had been very limited in its exercise of its powers chief justice marshall knew that if the court decided for <UNK> jefferson would almost certainly ignore the decision a result that would further erode the court s authority such a result arguably occurred about three zero years later when marshall ruled in worcester v georgia which struck down georgia laws affecting the <UNK> and president andrew jackson refused to compel the state of georgia to abide by the decision he is famously but <UNK> reported to have said john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it

burr treason case lastly there is evidence within the <UNK> opinion itself that indicates marshall would have expected compliance by the president with a contrary ruling the king never fails to comply with the judgment of his court although <UNK> v madison was the first case in which the u s supreme court exercised the power of judicial review it was a narrowly based decision it declared unconstitutional a power which congress sought to grant to the court itself and it was found to conflict with article iii of the constitution which governs the federal courts <UNK> thus lies in the intersection between judicial review in the modern sense and the older theory that each branch of government is responsible to the people for keeping its own acts within the bounds of constitutionality jackson held that he had no constitutional power to enforce worcester v georgia for example no general federal law was struck down until dred scott v <UNK> in one eight five seven

bonham s case eight co rep one zero seven a that decision arose under a statute of parliament enabling the london college of physicians to levy fines against anyone who violated their rules the college accused a doctor of practice without their license and fined him accordingly coke found that their statutory powers violated common right or reason because no person should be a judge in his own case the idea that courts could declare statutes void waxed and 
then waned in england but it was well known in the american colonies and in the bars of young states where coke s books were very influential the doctrine was specifically enshrined in some state

no scholar to date has identified even one participant in the ratification fight who argued that the constitution did not authorize judicial review of federal statutes this silence in the face of the numerous comments on the other side is revealing however it is important to note that nothing in the text of the constitution explicitly authorized the power of judicial review despite persistent fears voiced by <UNK> over the power of the new federal court system the concept was also laid out by hamilton in federalist no seven eight if it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments it may be answered that this cannot be the natural presumption where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the constitution it is not otherwise to be supposed that the constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents it is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature in order among other things to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority the interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts a constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law it therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body if there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two that which has the superior obligation and validity ought of course to be preferred or in other words the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute the intention of the people to the intention of their agents however many <UNK> republicans and later <UNK> democrats launched attacks on the court backed by their argument that congressional or presidential interpretations of the constitution were entitled to as much respect as those of the court they noted that the concept of independent review exercised by federal courts had been effectively created by judicial gloss in <UNK> in fact during the nineteenth century and into the twentieth almost as much debate in congress revolved around the constitutionality in contrast to the substance of proposed legislation but in one nine five eight s cooper v aaron the court essentially declared such debates irrelevant by asserting for itself sole authority to pass on the constitutionality of legislation in cooper the court reasoned that in swearing to uphold the constitution public officials are referring to the constitution as interpreted by federal courts not by the public officials themselves thus presidents today often sign legislation they believe to be unconstitutional george w bush for example declared his belief that the mccain <UNK> campaign finance bill was unconstitutional but signed the law anyway relevant law u s <UNK> art iii two clause two in all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consuls and those in which a state shall be a party the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction in all the other cases within the judicial power of the united states the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make judiciary act of one seven eight nine one three the supreme court shall also have appellate jurisdiction from the circuit courts and courts of the several states in the cases herein after provided for and shall have power to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts and writs of <UNK> to any courts appointed or persons holding office under the authority of the united states the issue there are two ways the supreme court can hear a case one filing directly in the supreme court or two filing in some lower court such as a district court and appealing all the way up to the supreme court the first is an exercise of the court s original jurisdiction the second is appellate jurisdiction because <UNK> filed his petition for the writ of <UNK> directly in the supreme court the court needed to be able to exercise original jurisdiction over the case in order to have the power to hear it however the constitution specifically enumerates in art iii what types of cases the supreme court can hear under its original jurisdiction the problem is that most legal scholars agree that <UNK> s 
case doesn t fit under any of those types of cases <UNK> s argument is that in the judiciary act of one seven eight nine congress granted the supreme court original jurisdiction over petitions for writs of <UNK> this raises several issues that marshall has to address does art iii of the constitution create a floor for original jurisdiction that congress can add to or does it create an exhaustive list that congress can t modify at all if art iii s original jurisdiction is an exhaustive list but congress tries to modify it anyway who wins that conflict congress or the constitution and more importantly who is supposed to decide who wins in his answer to this last question marshall creates the notion of judicial review the decision an engraving of justice marshall made by charles <UNK> julien <UNK> de saint m min in one eight zero eight the court rendered a unanimous four zero decision on february two four one eight zero three chief justice marshall wrote the opinion of the court marshall presents the case as raising three distinct questions did <UNK> have a right to the petition do the laws of the country give <UNK> a legal remedy is asking the supreme court for a writ of <UNK> the correct legal remedy marshall quickly answers the first two questions <UNK> marshall finds that the failure to deliver the commission was <UNK> of a vested legal right in deciding whether <UNK> has a remedy marshall states the government of the united states has been emphatically termed a government of laws and not of men it will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right one of the key legal principles established by <UNK> is the notion that for every violation of a vested legal right there must be a legal remedy marshall next describes two distinct types of executive actions political actions where the official can exercise discretion and purely ministerial functions where the official is legally required to do something marshall finds that delivering the appointment to <UNK> was a purely ministerial function required by law and therefore the law provides him a remedy note it has become the tradition in u s judicial opinions that issues of jurisdiction are addressed first if a court does not have the power to hear a case it will not issue <UNK> chief justice marshall however did not address jurisdictional issues until addressing the first two questions presented above in analyzing the third question marshall first examines the judiciary act of one seven eight nine and determines that the act purports to give the supreme court original jurisdiction over writs of <UNK> marshall then looks to article iii of the constitution which defines the supreme court s original and appellate jurisdictions see relevant law above <UNK> had argued that the constitution was only intended to set a floor for original jurisdiction that congress could add to marshall disagrees and holds that congress does not have the power to modify the supreme court s original jurisdiction consequently marshall finds that the constitution and the judiciary act conflict this conflict raises the important question of what happens when an act of congress conflicts with the constitution in the eyes of the supreme court marshall answers that acts of congress that conflict with the constitution are not law and the courts are bound instead to follow the constitution affirming the principle of judicial review in support of this position marshall looks to the nature of the written constitution there would be no point of having a written constitution if the courts could just ignore it to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained marshall also argues that the very nature of the judicial function requires courts to make this determination since it is a court s duty to decide cases courts have to be able to decide what law applies to each case therefore if two laws conflict with each other a court must decide which law applies finally marshall points to the judge s oath requiring them to uphold the constitution and to the supremacy clause of the constitution which lists the constitution before the laws of the united states part of the core of this reasoning is found in the following statements from the decision it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department the courts to say what the law is those judges who apply the rule of law to particular cases must of necessity <UNK> and interpret that rule if two laws conflict with each other the courts must decide on the operation of each so if a law e g a statute or treaty be in opposition to the constitution if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case so that the court must either decide that case <UNK> to the law disregarding the constitution or <UNK> to the constitution disregarding the law the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case this is of the very essence of judicial duty if then the courts are to regard the constitution and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature the constitution and not such ordinary act must govern the case to which they both apply those then who <UNK> the principle that the constitution is to be considered in court as a paramount law are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution and see only the law e g the statute or treaty this doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions five u s at one seven seven seven eight criticisms some legal scholars have raised questions about the logic marshall used in determining the judiciary act unconstitutional and 
hence the legitimacy of judicial review it is alleged that marshall selectively quoted the judiciary act interpreting it to grant the supreme court the power to hear writs of <UNK> on original jurisdiction as the relevant law section above shows there is little connection between the notion of original jurisdiction and the supreme court and the act seems to affirm instead the court s power to exercise only appellate jurisdiction furthermore it is argued that the supreme court should have been able to issue the writ on original jurisdiction based on the fact that article iii of the constitution granted it the right to review on original jurisdiction all cases affecting public ministers and consuls and that james madison secretary of state at the time and defendant of the suit should have fallen into that category of a public minister or consul questions have also frequently been raised about the logic of marshall s argument for judicial review for example by alexander <UNK> in his book the least dangerous branch <UNK> argues that marshall s argument implies an <UNK> mechanical view of jurisprudence one which suggests that the court has an absolute duty to strike down every law it finds <UNK> of the constitution under marshall s conception of the judicial process in <UNK> judges themselves have no independent agency and can never take into account the consequences of their actions when deciding cases a notion that has been attacked by richard <UNK> more generally marshall s argument for the notion of a judicial obligation to strike down laws <UNK> to the constitution presupposes some sort of underlying meaning to the text of the u s constitution which judges can divine a notion that is contested by such scholars as paul brest and duncan kennedy as well as by richard <UNK> because the constitution lacks a clear statement authorizing the federal courts to nullify the acts of <UNK> branches critics contend that the argument for judicial review must rely on a significant gloss on the constitution s terms despite such criticisms of <UNK> v madison judicial review has been widely accepted in american society as a legitimate function of the

criteria establish insanity in the legal and not the psychological sense the guidelines were formulated by the house of lords in m <UNK> s case one eight four three one zero c not guilty by reason of insanity and the sentence is either a mandatory and indeterminate period of treatment in a secure hospital facility or at the discretion of the court depending on the country the defence is recognized in australia canada england and wales new zealand the republic of ireland and most u s states with the exception of montana idaho and utah explanation insanity as a defence operates as an excuse i e it excludes the accused from the process of a trial which makes it consistent with public policies about criminal responsibility and the function of criminal law at one level it is a rationale of compassion accepting that it is morally wrong to treat a person as criminal if because of severe mental illness or intellectual disability he or she is temporarily or permanently deprived of the capacity either to choose whether to obey law or to distinguish right from wrong this may suggest that the insanity provisions operate at the most fundamental level to negate the mens rea element in any offense cf <UNK> <UNK> in which children are excused from criminal liability due to a presumed incapacity to form a criminal intent a more utilitarian justification for <UNK> any given behavior is as a deterrent yet if this class of potential offender is genuinely insane no law or threat of punishment will be effective as a deterrent indeed if the state is seen to punish the mentally ill this may actually undermine public confidence in the penal system thus the better rationale for the choice of compulsory medical treatment is a general social duty to encourage rehabilitation in states where the consequence of satisfying the rules was indefinite detention insanity was rarely invoked when the accused was charged with a relatively minor offense it was better to plead to the charge and receive a determinate prison sentence hence insanity was mainly used in murder cases where the threat of capital punishment offered a genuine incentive to plead insanity as an alternative to death the fact that murder no longer carries a capital sentence in the majority of countries may remove the incentive to plead it assuming no change in the <UNK> powers of the court after a successful insanity defence a practical issue is whether the fact that an accused is <UNK> under a mental disability should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i e whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done to know that what one is doing is wrong or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions for example the irish insanity defence comprises the m <UNK> rules and a control test which asks whether the accused was <UNK> from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness see doyle v wicklow county council one nine seven four five five ir seven one but the butler committee in england recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility in effect creating an <UNK> presumption of <UNK> arising from proof of a severe mental disorder this has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental <UNK> rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility the law should be geared to <UNK> not mere psychiatric diagnosis the rules in english law the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction burden of proof this is a <UNK> presumption and the burden of proof is on the party wishing to <UNK> if a jury think it is more likely than not that the is insane within the meaning of the rules the defendant is entitled 
to a verdict in his favor the common law rule based on lord <UNK> s judgement in <UNK> v attorney general for northern ireland one nine six three ac three eight six is that wherever the defendant makes an issue of his or her state of mind during a trial the prosecution can <UNK> evidence of his insanity in r v clarke one nine seven two one aer two one nine a woman charged with a minor s one theft claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent <UNK> walked out of the shop without paying when the prosecution began to <UNK> evidence under the rules she changed her plea to guilty on appeal the conviction was <UNK> and the general rule of practice introduced to limit the prosecution s ability to introduce the rules to cases in which the defect of reason was substantial the test and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know it that he did not know what he was doing was wrong given that the test examines the accused s knowledge and understanding the focus is on mens rea issues in dpp v harper one nine nine seven it was held that insanity is not generally a defence to strict liability offences in this instance the accused was driving with excess alcohol by definition the accused is sufficiently aware of the nature of the activity to commit the <UNK> <UNK> of driving and presumably knows that driving while drunk is legally wrong any other feature of the accused s knowledge is irrelevant at the time the focus of interest is the state of mind at the time the accused engages in behavior resulting in a criminal outcome it is irrelevant that as a result of treatment the accused may be entirely sane at the time the matter comes before a court disease of the mind whether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind within the rules is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation it seems that any disease which produces a <UNK> of the mind is a disease of the mind and need not be a disease of the brain it covers any internal as opposed to external disorder which results in violence and is likely to recur r v kemp one nine five

that the state was transitory was irrelevant r v quick we accept that sleep is a normal condition but the evidence in the instant case indicates that <UNK> and particularly violence in sleep is not normal more generally see <UNK> case law defect of reason the disease of the mind must have given rise to a defect of reason which had one of two consequences either a the defendant did not know the nature and quality of his act or b he did not know his act was wrong thus the requirement is that the defendant s power to reason is impaired in a substantial way r v clarke one nine seven two one aer two one nine confirms that this must be something more than a state of confusion or <UNK> more interesting is whether the rules should be invoked in cases involving the battered woman syndrome nature and quality of the actions this phrase refers to the physical nature and quality of the act rather than the moral quality it covers the situation where the defendant does not know what he is physically doing kenny gives the example of a madman who cuts a woman s throat believing that he is cutting a loaf of bread knowledge that the act was wrong this requirement is a reference to the law rather than the morality the defendant must not know that he was doing something legally wrong delusions the judges were asked in m <UNK> s case if a person could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion they replied that if he labors under such partial delusion only and is not in other respects insane he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real this rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be if the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence in r v bell one nine eight four clr six eight five the defendant used a van to smash through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because it was like a secret society in there i wanted to do my bit against it as instructed by god it was held that as the defendant had been aware of his actions he could not have been in a state of <UNK> nor insane and the fact that he believed that god had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing that what he was doing was wrong in the legal sense specific conditions may induce the delusions the court in r v <UNK> one nine five two accepted that folie a deux may cause a defect of 
reason over a period of many years a husband who had acted as a <UNK> for his wife who had a mental illness came to share similar symptoms the jury s one criminal procedure insanity and <UNK> to plead act one nine nine one provides that a jury shall not return a special verdict that the accused is not guilty by reason of insanity except on the written or oral evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners of whom at least one has special experience in the field of mental disorder this may require the jury to decide between conflicting medical evidence which they are not necessarily equipped to do but the law goes further and allows them to disagree with the experts if there are facts or surrounding circumstances which in the opinion of the court justify the jury in coming to that conclusion sentencing under s three act one nine nine one where the sentence for the offence to which the finding relates is fixed by law e g murder the court must make a hospital order

s census bureau about metropolitan and <UNK> statistics one of the remarkable characteristics of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics which distinguishes it from mathematical formulations of theories developed prior to the early one nine zero zero s is its use of abstract mathematical structures such as hilbert spaces and operators on these spaces many of these structures had not even been considered before the twentieth century in a general sense they are drawn from functional analysis a subject within pure mathematics that developed in parallel with and was influenced by the needs of quantum mechanics in brief physical quantities such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as functions on some phase space but as operators on such functions this formulation of quantum mechanics called canonical quantization continues to be used today and still forms the basis of ab initio calculations in atomic molecular and solid state physics at the heart of the description is an idea of quantum state which for systems of atomic scale is radically different from the previous models of physical reality while the mathematics is a complete description and permits calculation of many quantities that can be measured experimentally there is a definite limit to access for an observer with macroscopic instruments this limitation was first elucidated by heisenberg through a thought experiment and is represented mathematically by the non commutativity of quantum observables prior to the emergence of quantum mechanics as a separate theory the mathematics used in physics consisted mainly of differential geometry and partial differential equations probability theory was used in statistical mechanics geometric intuition clearly played a strong role in the first two and accordingly theories of relativity were formulated entirely in terms of geometric concepts the phenomenology of quantum physics arose roughly between one eight nine five and one nine one five and for the one zero to one five years before the emergence of quantum theory around one nine two five physicists continued to think of quantum theory within the confines of what is now called classical physics and in particular within the same mathematical structures the most sophisticated example of this is the sommerfeld wilson <UNK> quantization rule which was formulated entirely on the classical phase space history of the formalism the old quantum theory and the need for new mathematics main article old quantum theory in the decade of one eight nine zero planck was able to derive the blackbody spectrum and solve the classical ultraviolet catastrophe by making the unorthodox assumption that in the interaction of radiation with matter energy could only be exchanged in discrete units which he called quanta planck postulated a direct proportionality between the frequency of radiation and the quantum of energy at that frequency the proportionality constant h is now called planck s constant in his honour in one nine zero five einstein explained certain features of the photoelectric effect by assuming that planck s light quanta were actual particles which he called photons a sketch to justify spectroscopy observations for hydrogen atoms in one nine one three bohr calculated the spectrum of the hydrogen atom with the help of a new model of the atom in which the electron could orbit the proton only on a discrete set of classical orbits determined by the condition that angular momentum was an integer multiple of planck s constant electrons could make quantum leaps from one orbit to another emitting or absorbing single quanta of light at the right frequency all of these developments were phenomenological and flew in the face of the theoretical physics of the time bohr and sommerfeld went on to modify classical mechanics in an attempt to deduce the bohr model from first principles they proposed that of all closed classical orbits traced by a mechanical system in its phase space only the ones that enclosed an area which was a multiple of planck s constant were actually allowed the most sophisticated version of this formalism was the so called sommerfeld wilson <UNK> quantization although the bohr model of the hydrogen atom could be explained in this way the spectrum of the helium atom classically an unsolvable three body problem could not be predicted the mathematical status of quantum theory remained uncertain for some time in one nine two three de broglie proposed that wave particle duality applied not only to photons but to electrons and every other physical system the situation changed 
rapidly in the years one nine two five one nine three zero when working mathematical foundations were found through the groundbreaking work of erwin schr dinger and werner heisenberg and the foundational work of john von neumann hermann weyl and paul dirac and it became possible to unify several different approaches in terms of a fresh set of ideas the new quantum theory erwin schr dinger s wave mechanics originally was the first successful attempt at replicating the observed quantization of atomic spectra with the help of a precise mathematical realization of de broglie s wave particle duality schr dinger proposed an equation now bearing his name for the wave associated to an electron in an atom according to de broglie and explained energy quantization by the well known fact that differential operators of the kind appearing in his equation had a discrete spectrum however schr dinger himself initially did not understand the fundamental probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics as he thought that the amplitude squared wavefunction of an electron must be interpreted as the charge density of an object <UNK> out over an extended possibly infinite volume of space it was max born who introduced the probabilistic interpretation of the amplitude squared wave function as the probability distribution of the position of a <UNK> object with hindsight schr dinger s wave function can be seen to be closely related to the classical hamilton jacobi equation werner heisenberg s matrix mechanics formulation introduced <UNK> to schr dinger s wave mechanics and based on algebras of infinite matrices was certainly very radical in light of the mathematics of classical physics in fact at the time linear algebra was not generally known to physicists in its present form the reconciliation of the two approaches is generally associated to paul dirac who wrote a lucid account in his one nine three zero classic principles of quantum mechanics in it he introduced the bra ket notation together with an abstract formulation in terms of the hilbert space used in functional analysis and showed that sch dinger s and heisenberg s approaches were two different representations of the same theory dirac s method is now called canonical quantization the first complete mathematical formulation of this approach is generally credited to john von neumann s one nine three two book mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics although hermann weyl had already referred to hilbert spaces which he called unitary spaces in his one nine two seven classic book it was developed in parallel with a new approach to the mathematical spectral theory based on linear operators rather than the quadratic forms that were david hilbert s approach a generation earlier though theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve to this day there is a basic framework for the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics which underlies most approaches and can be traced back to the mathematical work of john von neumann in other words discussions about interpretation of the theory and extensions to it are now mostly conducted on the basis of shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations later developments the application of the new quantum theory to electromagnetism resulted in quantum field theory which was developed starting around one nine three zero quantum field theory has driven the development of more sophisticated formulations of quantum mechanics of which the one presented here is a simple special case in fact the difficulties involved in implementing any of the following formulations cannot be said yet to have been solved in a satisfactory fashion except for ordinary quantum mechanics feynman path integrals axiomatic algebraic and constructive quantum field theory geometric quantization quantum field theory in curved spacetime c algebra formalism on a different front von neumann originally dispatched quantum measurement with his infamous postulate on the collapse of the wavefunction raising a host of philosophical problems over the intervening seven zero years the problem of measurement became an active research area and itself spawned some new formulations of quantum mechanics relative state many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics <UNK> consistent histories formulation of quantum mechanics quantum logic formulation of quantum mechanics a related topic is the relationship to classical mechanics any new physical theory is supposed to reduce to successful old theories in some approximation for quantum mechanics this translates into the need to study the so called classical limit of quantum mechanics also as bohr emphasized human cognitive abilities and language are inextricably linked to the classical realm and so classical descriptions are intuitively more accessible than quantum ones in particular quantization namely the construction of a quantum theory whose classical limit is a given and known classical theory becomes an important area of quantum physics in itself finally some of the originators of quantum theory notably einstein and schr dinger were unhappy with what they thought were the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics in particular einstein took the position that quantum mechanics must be incomplete which motivated research into so called hidden variable theories the issue of hidden variables has become in part an experimental issue with the help of quantum optics de broglie bohm bell pilot wave formulation of quantum mechanics bell s inequalities <UNK> <UNK> theorem mathematical structure of quantum mechanics a physical system is generally described by three basic ingredients states observables and dynamics or law of time evolution or more generally a group of physical symmetries a classical description can be given in a fairly direct way by a phase space model of mechanics states are points in a symplectic phase space observables are real valued functions on it time evolution is given by a one parameter group of symplectic transformations of the phase space and physical symmetries are realized by symplectic transformations a quantum description consists of a hilbert space of states observables are self adjoint operators on the space of states time evolution is given by a one parameter group of unitary transformations on the hilbert space of states and physical symmetries are realized by unitary transformations postulates of quantum mechanics the 
following summary of the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics can be partly traced back to von neumann s postulates each physical system is associated with a separable complex hilbert space h with inner product langle phi mid psi rangle rays one dimensional <UNK> in h are associated with states of the system in other words physical states can be identified with equivalence classes of vectors of length one in h where two vectors represent the same state if they differ only by a phase factor <UNK> is a mathematically convenient hypothesis with the physical interpretation that countably many observations are enough to uniquely determine the state the hilbert space of a composite system is the hilbert space tensor product of the state spaces associated with the component systems for a non relativistic system consisting of a finite number of distinguishable particles the component systems are the individual particles physical symmetries act on the hilbert space of quantum states <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> is another matter entirely physical observables are represented by densely defined self adjoint operators on h the expected value in the sense of probability theory of the observable a for the system in state represented by the unit vector left psi right rangle in h is langle psi mid a mid psi rangle by spectral theory we can associate a probability distribution to the values of a in any state we can also show that the possible values of the observable a in any state must belong to the spectrum of a in the special case a has discrete spectrum the possible values of a in any state are its eigenvalues more generally a state can be represented by a so called density operator which is a trace class <UNK> self adjoint operator rho normalized to be of trace one the expected value of a in the state rho is operatorname a rho if rho psi is the orthogonal projector onto the one dimensional subspace of h spanned by left psi right rangle then operatorname a rho psi left langle psi mid a mid psi right rangle density operators are those that are in the closure of the convex hull of the one dimensional orthogonal projectors conversely one dimensional orthogonal projectors are extreme points of the set of density operators physicists also call one dimensional orthogonal projectors pure states and other density operators mixed states one can in this formalism state heisenberg s uncertainty principle and prove it as a theorem although the exact historical sequence of events concerning who derived what and under which framework is the subject of historical investigations outside the scope of this article <UNK> sectors the correspondence between states and rays needs to be refined somewhat to take into account so called <UNK> sectors states in different <UNK> sectors cannot influence each other and the relative phases between them are <UNK> pictures of dynamics in the so called schr dinger picture of quantum mechanics the dynamics is given as follows the time evolution of the state is given by a differentiable function from the real numbers r representing <UNK> of time to the hilbert space of system states this map is characterized by a differential equation as follows if left psi left t right right rangle denotes the state of the system at any one time t the following schr dinger equation holds i hbar frac left psi t right rangle h left psi t right rangle where h is a densely defined self adjoint operator called the system hamiltonian i is the imaginary unit and hbar is the reduced planck constant as an observable h corresponds to the total energy of the system alternatively by stone s theorem one can state that there is a continuous one parameter unitary group u t h h such that left psi t s right rangle u t left psi s right rangle for all times s t the existence of a self adjoint hamiltonian h such that u t e is a consequence of stone s theorem on one parameter unitary groups the heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics focuses on observables and instead of considering states as varying in time it regards the states as fixed and the observables as changing to go from the schr dinger to the heisenberg picture one needs to define time independent states and time dependent operators thus left psi right rangle left psi zero right rangle a t u t au t quad it is then easily checked that the expected values of all observables are the same in both pictures langle psi mid a t mid psi rangle langle psi t mid a mid psi t rangle and that the time dependent heisenberg operators satisfy i <UNK> t a t h this assumes a is not time dependent in the schr dinger picture the so called dirac picture or interaction picture has time dependent states and observables evolving with respect to different <UNK> this picture is most useful when the evolution of the states can be solved exactly confining any complications to the evolution of the operators for this reason the hamiltonian for states is called free hamiltonian and the hamiltonian for observables is called interaction hamiltonian in symbols i hbar frac left psi t right rangle operatorname left psi t right rangle i <UNK> t a t h the interaction picture does not always exist though in interacting quantum field theories haag s theorem states that the interaction picture does not exist this is because the hamiltonian cannot be split into a free and an interacting part within a <UNK> sector the heisenberg picture is the closest to classical mechanics but the schr dinger picture is considered easiest to understand by most people to judge from pedagogical accounts of quantum mechanics the dirac picture is the one used in perturbation theory and is specially associated to quantum field theory similar equations can be written for any one parameter unitary group of symmetries of the physical system time 
would be replaced by a suitable coordinate <UNK> the unitary group for instance a rotation angle or a translation distance and the hamiltonian would be replaced by the conserved quantity associated to the symmetry for instance angular or linear momentum representations the original form of the schr dinger equation depends on choosing a particular representation of heisenberg s canonical <UNK> relations the stone von neumann theorem states all irreducible representations of the finite dimensional heisenberg <UNK> relations are <UNK> equivalent this is related to quantization and the correspondence between classical and quantum mechanics and is therefore not strictly part of the general mathematical framework the quantum harmonic oscillator is an exactly solvable system where the possibility of choosing among more than one representation can be seen in all its glory there apart from the schr dinger position or momentum representation one encounters the fock number representation and the <UNK> segal phase space or coherent state representation all three are <UNK> equivalent time as an operator the framework presented so far singles out time as the parameter that everything depends on it is possible to formulate mechanics in such a way that time becomes itself an observable associated to a self adjoint operator at the classical level it is possible to arbitrarily <UNK> the trajectories of particles in terms of an <UNK> parameter s and in that case the time t becomes an additional generalized coordinate of the physical system at the quantum level translations in s would be generated by a hamiltonian h e where e is the energy operator and h is the ordinary hamiltonian however since s is an <UNK> parameter physical states must be left invariant by s evolution and so the physical state space is the kernel of h e this requires the use of a rigged hilbert space and a renormalization of the norm this is related to quantization of constrained systems and quantization of gauge theories the problem of measurement the picture given in the preceding paragraphs is sufficient for description of a completely isolated system however it fails to account for one of the main differences between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics that is the effects of measurement wavefunction collapse when von neumann proposed his mathematical postulate for quantum mechanics he included the following measurement postulate carrying out a measurement of an observable a with discrete spectrum on a system in the state represented by left psi right rangle will cause the system state to collapse into an <UNK> i e <UNK> left psi a right rangle of the operator the observed value corresponds to the eigenvalue a of the <UNK> a left psi a right rangle a left psi a right rangle mathematically the collapse corresponds to orthogonal projection of left psi right rangle onto the <UNK> of a corresponding to the observed value a von neumann s postulate regarding the effects of measurement has always been a source of confusion and speculation fortunately there is a general mathematical theory of such irreversible operations see quantum operation and various physical interpretations of the mathematics the relative state interpretation an alternative interpretation of measurement is everett s relative state interpretation which was later dubbed many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics list of mathematical tools part of the folklore of the subject concerns the mathematical physics textbook courant hilbert put together by richard courant from david hilbert s g ttingen university courses the story is told by mathematicians that physicists had dismissed the material as not interesting in the current research areas until the advent of schr dinger s equation at that point it was realised that the mathematics of the new quantum mechanics was already laid out in it it is also said that heisenberg had consulted hilbert about his matrix mechanics and hilbert observed that his own experience with infinite dimensional matrices had derived from differential equations advice which heisenberg ignored missing the opportunity to unify the theory as weyl and dirac did a few years later whatever the basis of the anecdotes the mathematics of theory was conventional at the time where the physics was radically new the main tools include linear algebra

had straight branches not rounded as is often depicted see this article for a discussion of this issue jewish depictions of the menorah dating back to temple times along with the depiction on the arch of titus showing the romans taking the looted menorah to rome after the temple s destruction contradict this claim an alternative theory to the origin of the design of the menorah is based on what is known about ancient hebrew cosmology according to this theory the seven branches represent the seven heavenly bodies known at the time namely the sun and the moon as well as mercury venus mars jupiter

transit system resembling a metro or railroad with 
a track consisting of a single rail <UNK> as opposed to the traditional track with two parallel rails there are two types of <UNK> straddle beam and suspended the term monorail or industrial monorail is also used to describe any number of systems in which a chair or carrier is suspended from an overhead rail structure for the limited transportation of goods or workers background <UNK> balanced monorail one nine zero seven by brennan and <UNK> attempts at creating unconventional railways have been made since the latter part of the one nine th century usually these have been claimed to be more efficient faster or cheaper to construct than conventional railways several attempts have been made to create a system in which a double <UNK> steel wheel operates on a single rail similar to the railroad type of rail the <UNK> monorail described below is the only surviving monorail of this type <UNK> have both benefited and suffered from their novelty and concept of modernity when the walt disney company placed a monorail in their disneyland theme park in one nine five five it exposed large numbers of visitors to the transportation form in a credible though miniature transit setting at the same time however the disneyland monorail and others built at other disney properties and amusement locations have tended to identify <UNK> with <UNK> rather than practical transportation the popular press in the u s in mid two zero th century often featured monorail ideas in a transportation of the future context but this same press also displayed images of personal rocket <UNK> and popular space travel creating interest but also confusion as to which ideas were fads and which might become reality types and technical aspects modern <UNK> depend on a large solid beam as the vehicles running surface there are a number of competing designs divided into two broad classes straddle beam and suspended <UNK> the most common type of monorail in use today is the straddle beam monorail in which the train straddles a reinforced concrete beam in the range of two to three feet zero six zero nine m wide a rubber tired carriage contacts the beam on the top and both sides for traction and to stabilize the vehicle the straddle beam style was popularized by the german company <UNK> there is also a form of suspended monorail developed by the french company <UNK> in which the train cars are suspended beneath the wheel carriage in this design the carriage wheels ride inside the single beam power <UNK> today are powered by electric motors fed by dual third rails contact wires or electrified channels attached to or enclosed in their guidance beams switching switching has been a perennial issue with monorail systems since simple switching mechanisms associated with other systems are usually not feasible some early monorail systems notably the suspended monorail of <UNK> germany dating from one nine zero one and still in operation have a design that makes it difficult to switch from one line to another some other monorail systems avoid switching as much as possible by operating in a continuous loop or between two fixed stations as in seattle washington current operating <UNK> are capable of more efficient switching than in the past in the case of suspended <UNK> switching may be accomplished by moving <UNK> inside the <UNK> to shift trains to one line or another straddle beam <UNK> require that the beam structure itself be moved to accomplish switching which originally was an almost prohibitively <UNK> procedure now however the most common way of achieving this is to place a moving apparatus on top of a sturdy platform capable of bearing the weight of vehicles beams and its own mechanism <UNK> segmented beams move into place on rollers to smoothly align one beam with another to send the train in its desired direction some of these beam <UNK> are quite elaborate capable of switching between several beams or even simulating a railroad double crossover in cases where it must be possible to move a monorail train from one beam to any of a number of other beams as in storage or repair shops a traveling beam not unlike a railroad transfer table may be employed a single beam at least long enough to carry a single monorail vehicle is aligned at an entry beam to be mounted by the monorail cars the entire beam then rolls with the vehicle to align with the desired storage beam systems similar in appearance the term monorail is often applied by members of the public to any modern elevated railway particularly automated ones such as the docklands light railway vancouver <UNK> and the jfk <UNK> but this usage is erroneous these systems use the same twin rails and electric third rail as most underground <UNK> and some main line railways advantages and disadvantages sydney monorail advantages the primary advantage of <UNK> over conventional rail systems is that they require minimal space both horizontally and vertically the width required is determined by the monorail vehicle not the track and monorail systems are commonly elevated requiring only a minimal footprint for support pillars due to a smaller footprint they are seen as more attractive than conventional elevated rail lines and visually block only a minimal amount of sky they are quieter as modern <UNK> use rubber wheels on a concrete track though some non monorail subway systems like certain lines of the paris metro and all of the montreal metro use the same technique and are equally quiet <UNK> are capable of climbing descending and turning faster than most conventional rail systems unlike conventional rail systems straddle <UNK> wrap around their track and are thus not physically capable of <UNK> unless the track itself suffers a catastrophic failure the disneyland monorail disadvantages a monorail switch by its very design will leave one track hanging in mid air at any given time an incorrectly positioned or jammed switch could thus cause the monorail to derail 
and fall although the risk can be mitigated by careful design and there are no documented cases of this actually happening in an emergency passengers cannot immediately exit because the monorail vehicle is high above ground and not all systems have emergency walkways the passengers must sometimes wait until a fire engine or a cherry <UNK> comes to the rescue newer monorail systems resolve this by building emergency walkways alongside the entire track partial list of monorail systems monorail systems have been built in many countries around the world many of them on elevated tracks

seven notes eight if one includes the octave which is actually the first note of the next octave of the scale when the octaves are compounded as they usually are in practice as opposed to the more theoretical perception of the seven note system they are considered to be divided into two groups of four the <UNK> the pattern of steps in each <UNK> is in ascending order tone tone semitone tone the major scale has seven notes plus the inclusion of the tonic of the next scale to complete an octave in practise which in <UNK> are the syllables do re mi fa sol la ti and do at the piano keyboard the simplest major scale is c major see figure one it is unique in that it is the only major scale to not use sharps or flats on the musical staff and likewise only the white notes on the keyboard listen to the c major scale the c major scale when writing out major and minor scales every line and space on the stave has to be filled and no note can have more than one accidental this has the effect of forcing the key signature to feature just sharps or just flats ordinary major scales never include both the major scale is the same as the ionian mode constructing major scales analyzing scales with sharps scales and key signatures are closely linked in music it is necessary to construct a key signature consisting of a number of sharps or flats in order to know which notes a particular major scale will have an easy but time consuming way to do this would be to use the pattern of tone tone semitone etc given above if we choose to write the scale of d major we know immediately that the scale begins on a d the next note will be a tone above an e the note after that will also be a tone above however it is not simply an f as would seem obvious because the difference between an e and an f is actually a semitone look on a piano keyboard there is no black note in between them it is necessary to raise the f to become an f sharp to achieve a difference of a whole tone this could be followed to create a whole scale with all the sharps or with a different scale flats put correctly in however a more clever 
way of constructing scales arises from analysing patterns in the whole series of major scales starting on the scale of c major there exists no sharps or flats if you start a new scale on the five th of c major g major you will find one sharp <UNK> the f starting the scale on the five th of g major a d it will be necessary to put two sharps in an f sharp and a c sharp writing this pattern out for all the scales looks like this c maj zero sharps g maj one sharp f f meaning f sharp d maj two sharps f c a maj three sharps f c g e maj four sharps f c g d b maj five sharps f c g d a f maj six sharps f c g d a e c maj seven sharps f c g d a e b in this table it can be seen that for each new scale starting on the fifth of the previous scale it is necessary to add a new sharp the order of sharps which need to be added follows f c g d a e b this pattern of the sharps can be easily remembered through the use of the mnemonic f c g d a e b fat cats go dancing after each breakfast looking closer the last accidental added matches the tonic first note of the scale two fifths before it in this table two lines up a useful rule for use in recognising major scales with sharps is that the tonic is also always one note above the last sharp analysing major scales with flats a similar table can be constructed for major scales with flats in them in this case each new scale starts on the five th below the previous one c maj zero flats f maj one flat bb meaning b flat bb maj two flats bb eb eb maj three flats bb eb ab ab maj four flats bb eb ab db db maj five flats bb eb ab db gb gb maj six flats bb eb ab db gb cb cb maj seven flats bb eb ab db gb cb fb here a similar pattern can be recognised each new scale keeps all the flats of the previous scale but adds a new one following the sequence bb eb ab db gb cb fb interestingly this is the direct inverse of the pattern of sharps given above luckily the mnemonic can now be reversed to form the sentence b e a d g c f battle ends and down goes charles father again there is a similar but reversed relationship between <UNK> and accidentals the tonic matches the second to last flat added on the circle of fifths the information gathered from analysing scales can be used in constructing the circle of fifths image fifths png this is a useful way of finding key signatures of major scales starting clockwise from the top c each new letter represents a new scale a fifth above the one before it this means that each new scale clockwise requires an extra sharp to be added to its key signature the exact sharps to be added are found by reading off the letters starting from the f to the left of the c for example if we needed to know how many and which sharps a scale of e major requires we note that e is at position four it requires four sharps these sharps are reading off from f f c g d if you were faced with a major scale with a key signature of five sharps you would count off five from the top to arrive at b it is the scale of b major image b maj png fig two the b major scale similarly key signatures with flats can be created each new letter starting from f represents a new scale and the position of the letter indicates how many flats it has the actual flats are read <UNK> from the bb on position two bb is on position two so it has two flats bb and eb note names each of the eight notes in a major scale has a name one st note tonic two nd note <UNK> three rd note <UNK> four th note subdominant five th note dominant six th note <UNK> seven th note leading note eight th note tonic harmonic properties the major scale may predominate because of its unique harmonic properties it allows major or minor chords both stable and consonant on every scale degree but the seventh a diminished fifth in the seventh chord built on the fifth degree the dominant motion by a minor second from the leading tone to the tonic root motion by fifths the strongest root motion from nearly every degree in either direction

trying to defend the authenticity of <UNK> a movie which one individual claimed was based on their story entitled catch the wind while in medical school he wrote novels under the pen names john lange

find the chief suspect an underground <UNK> who was created to be the author surrogate then crichton gave that character three pages to justify his illegal practice some of crichton s fiction uses a literary technique called false document for example eaters of the dead is a fabricated recreation of the old english epic beowulf in the form of a scholastic translation of ahmad ibn <UNK> s tenth century manuscript other novels such as the andromeda strain and jurassic park incorporate fictionalized scientific documents in the form of diagrams computer output dna sequences footnotes and bibliography in the terminal man crichton created a dialog between two computer programs good natured saint george and evil minded martha variations on eliza in the end the charlie brown like saint

implanted with an experimental computerized device to control his seizures sphere contains a dialog in which a <UNK> scientist in an underwater lab tries to talk the omnipotent but innocent extraterrestrial life out of manifesting beautiful aquatic creatures that are harmful to human beings a common criticism of crichton s novels is that they are generally based on the conceit of a false revolution while the novels describe potentially world changing concepts such as alien plagues cloned dinosaurs and time travel the books always end with the threat destroyed or the scientific breakthrough lost in other words the events described in the novels might as well never have happened in the context of their fictional universes this allows crichton to avoid having to describe how

crichton has been critical of widespread belief of ets and ufos citing the fact that there is no conclusive proof of their existence crichton has commented that belief without a factual basis is more

the commonwealth club called environmentalism as a religion crichton describes what he sees as similarities between the structure of various religious views particularly judeo christian dogma and the

belief that it is the tendency of modern environmentalists to cling stubbornly to elements of their faith in spite of scientific evidence to the contrary crichton cites what he contends are

entitled why speculate delivered in two zero zero two to the international leadership forum crichton took the media to task for engaging in what he saw as pointless speculation rather than the delivery of facts as an example he pointed to a front page article of the march six new york times that speculated about the possible effects of u s president george w bush s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel crichton also singled out susan <UNK> s book backlash for criticism saying that it presented hundreds of pages of quasi statistical assertions based on a premise that was never demonstrated and that was almost certainly false he referred to what he calls the murray gell mann amnesia effect to describe the public s tendency to discount one story in a newspaper they may know to be false because of their knowledge of the subject but believe the same paper on subjects with which they are unfamiliar crichton used the latin expression <UNK> in uno <UNK> in omnibus which he translated as <UNK> in one part <UNK> in all to describe what he thought a more appropriate reaction should be the speech also made several references to crichton s by now familiar skepticism of

the tonic while some definitions of minor scale encompass modes with the minor third such as dorian mode most musicians use the term to refer to the natural minor harmonic minor and melodic minor scales described below also compare major and minor types of minor scales a natural minor scale has the following interval pattern whole step half step whole step whole step half step whole step whole step or tone semitone tone tone semitone tone tone if the scale is used with the corresponding key signature the natural minor scale is written with no accidentals for example in the key of a minor the natural minor scale is a b c d e f g a natural minor scale full octave ascending on a sometimes the natural minor scale is equated with the aeolian mode but a key characteristic of music in the minor mode in the common practice period of western music is the use of the leading tone a half step below the tonic music using the natural seventh degree called the <UNK> sounds modal to western ears this music is commonly used in peruvian and other ethnic music and by modern western composers such as vaughan williams who prefer this sound but in music written from the one six th to one nine th centuries the chord built on the dominant fifth scale degree is always a major triad at least at cadence points consequently the seventh degree of the scale must be raised with an accidental to make this possible the next most important chord the subdominant is typically a minor triad these considerations of harmony lead to the harmonic minor scale the same as the natural minor but with a <UNK> raised seventh degree for example in the key of a minor the harmonic minor scale is a b c d e f g a a harmonic minor the interval between the sixth and seventh degrees of this scale in this case f and g sharp is an augmented second while some composers notably mozart have used this interval to advantage in melodic composition other composers felt it to be an awkward leap thus for purposes of melody either the <UNK> is used or the sixth scale degree is raised either way there is a whole step between these two scale degrees considered more conducive to smooth melody writing traditionally music theorists have called these two options the ascending 
melodic also known as <UNK> <UNK> set form seven three four and descending melodic minor scales a melodic minor ascending a melodic minor descending but historically composers have not been consistent about using them in ascending and descending melodies just as often composers choose one form or the other based on whether one of the two notes is part of the most recent chord the prevailing harmony another reason might be the use of the <UNK> chord based on the third degree of the scale which is an augmented triad if the raised seventh degree is used some composers prefer the use of the major triad and thus use the lowered seventh degree finding key signatures minor modes use the same set of key signatures as major modes whichever signature corresponds to the step pattern of the natural minor scale is considered the key signature for that minor mode the major and minor keys which share the same signature are called relative so c major is the relative major of a minor and c minor is the relative minor of e flat major the relative major is found by raising the minor tonic note by three <UNK> an interval of a minor third if you know that the key signature of g major has one sharp see major scales for how to find this then its relative minor e minor also has one sharp in its key signature this table illustrates the relative major key signatures for minor scales additional note it is possible to construct minor scales which do not correspond to a key signature such as d flat minor with double sharps double flats this becomes possible for example db minor key signature bb eb ab db gb cb fb bb the bb is now double flatted db natural minor db eb fb gb ab bbb cb db db melodic minor ascending descending db eb fb gb ab bb c db cb bbb ab gb fb eb db db harmonic minor db eb fb gb ab bbb c db on rare occasions short passages of music will be in an <UNK> scale in this case c sharp minor see also major and minor musical mode diatonic functionality reference <UNK> robert o one

occur when two firms each working at different stages in the production of the same good combine conglomerate mergers take place when the two firms operate in different industries a unique type of merger called a reverse merger is used as a way of going public without the expense and time required by an ipo issues the occurrence of a merger often raises concerns in anti trust circles devices such as the <UNK> index can analyze the impact of a merger on a market and what if any action could prevent it regulatory bodies such as the european commission and the united states department of justice may investigate anti trust cases for monopolies dangers and have the power to block mergers the completion of a merger does not ensure the success of the resulting organization indeed many in some industries the majority mergers result in a net loss of value due to problems correcting problems caused by incompatibility whether 
of technology equipment or corporate culture <UNK> resources away from new investment and these problems may be exacerbated by inadequate research or by concealment of losses or liabilities at one of the partners overlapping subsidiaries or redundant staff may be allowed to continue creating inefficiency and conversely the new management may cut too many operations or personnel losing expertise and disrupting employee culture these problems are similar to those encountered in takeovers for the merger to not be considered a failure it must increase shareholder value faster than if the

two d three zero d d c two zero zero zero was a court case filed against microsoft corporation on may one eight one nine nine eight by the united states department of justice <UNK> and twenty u s states joel i klein was the lead prosecutor the plaintiffs alleged that microsoft abused monopoly power in its handling of operating system sales and web browser sales the issue central to the case was whether microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship internet explorer ie web browser software with its microsoft windows operating system <UNK> them together is alleged to have been responsible for microsoft s victory in the browser wars as every windows user had a copy of internet explorer it was further alleged that this unfairly restricted the market for competing web browsers such as netscape navigator that were slow to download over a modem or had to be purchased at a store underlying these disputes were questions over whether microsoft altered or manipulated its application programming interfaces apis to favor internet explorer over third party web browsers microsoft s conduct in forming restrictive licensing agreements with oem computer manufacturers and microsoft s intent in its course of conduct microsoft stated that the merging of microsoft windows and internet explorer was the result of innovation and competition and that the two were now the same product and were inextricably linked together and that consumers were now getting all the benefits of ie for free those who opposed microsoft s position countered that the browser was still a distinct and separate product which didn t need to be 
tied to the operating system since a separate version of internet explorer was available for mac os they also asserted that ie was not really free because its development and marketing costs may have kept the price of windows higher than it might otherwise have been the case was tried before u s district court judge thomas <UNK> jackson the <UNK> was initially represented by david <UNK> history government interest in microsoft s affairs had begun in one nine nine one with an inquiry by the federal trade commission over whether microsoft was abusing its monopoly on the pc operating system market the <UNK> commissioners <UNK> with a two two vote in one nine nine three and closed the investigation but the <UNK> opened its own investigation on august two one of that year resulting in a settlement on july one five one nine nine four in which microsoft consented not to tie other microsoft products to the sale of windows but remained free to integrate additional features into the operating system in the years that followed microsoft insisted that internet explorer which first appeared in the plus pack sold separately from windows nine five was not a product but a feature which it was allowed to add to windows the <UNK> did not agree with this definition however trial the trial started in may one nine nine eight with the us justice department and the attorneys general of twenty us states <UNK> microsoft for illegally <UNK> competition in order to protect and extend its software monopoly later in october the us justice department also sued microsoft for violating a one nine nine four consent decree by forcing computer makers to include its internet browser as a part of the installation of windows software during the antitrust case it was revealed that microsoft had threatened pc manufacturers with <UNK> their license to distribute windows if they removed the internet explorer icon from the initial desktop something that netscape had requested of its licensees microsoft chairman bill gates was called evasive and <UNK> by a source present at a session in which gates was questioned on his deposition he argued over the definitions of words such as compete jihad concerned ask and we businessweek reported early rounds of his deposition show him offering <UNK> answers and saying i don t recall so many times that even the presiding judge had to <UNK> worse many of the technology chief s denials and pleas of ignorance have been directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e mail gates both sent and received intel vice president steven <UNK> called as a witness quoted paul <UNK> a senior microsoft vice president as having stated an intention to extinguish and <UNK> rival netscape communications corporation and to cut off netscape s air supply by giving away a clone of netscape s flagship product for free the microsoft executive denied the allegations a number of <UNK> were submitted as evidence by microsoft during the trial including one that demonstrated that removing internet explorer from microsoft windows caused <UNK> and malfunctions in windows in the videotaped demonstration of what microsoft vice president james <UNK> s stated to be a seamless segment filmed on one pc the plaintiff noticed that some icons mysteriously disappear and reappear on the pc s desktop suggesting that the effects might have been falsified <UNK> admitted that the blame for the tape problems lied with some of his staff they ended up filming it grabbing the wrong screen shot he said of the incident later <UNK> re ran the demonstration and provided a new videotape but in so doing microsoft dropped the claim that windows is slowed down when internet explorer is removed mark murray a microsoft spokesperson <UNK> the government attorneys for <UNK> on issues like video production microsoft submitted a second inaccurate videotape into evidence later the same month as the first the issue in question was how easy or hard it was for america online users to download and install netscape navigator onto a windows pc microsoft s videotape showed the process as being quick and easy resulting in the netscape icon appearing on the user s desktop the government produced its own videotape of the same process revealing that microsoft s videotape had edited out a long and complex part of the procedure and that the netscape icon wasn t placed on the desktop requiring a user to search for it brad chase a microsoft vice president verified the government s tape and conceded that microsoft s own tape was inaccurate when the judge ordered microsoft to offer a version of windows which did not include internet explorer microsoft responded that the company would offer manufacturers a choice one version of windows that was obsolete or another that did not work properly the judge asked it seemed absolutely clear to you that i entered an order that required that you distribute a product that would not work david cole a microsoft vice president replied in plain english yes we followed that order it wasn t my place to consider the consequences of that princeton university professor edward <UNK> presented a modified version of windows from which he claimed the internet explorer function had been removed on cross examination he was guided through a sequence of steps that produced a fully functional internet explorer window microsoft

prices expanding outputs and a breathtaking 
array of new products and innovations increasingly however some firms have sought to handicap their rivals races by turning to government for protection many of these cases are based on speculation about some vaguely specified consumer harm in some unspecified future and many of the proposed interventions will weaken successful u s firms and impede their competitiveness abroad judge jackson issued his findings of fact on november five one nine nine nine which stated that microsoft s dominance of the personal computer operating systems market constituted a monopoly and that microsoft had taken actions to crush threats to the monopoly including apple java netscape lotus notes real networks linux and others then on april three two zero zero zero he issued a two part ruling his conclusions of law were that microsoft had committed <UNK> attempted <UNK> and tying in violation of sections one and two of the sherman act and his remedy was that microsoft must be broken into two separate units one to produce the operating system and one to produce other software components some argue that the outcome of the antitrust case has served to chill venture capital investment in technical startup companies for fear that microsoft will notice the startup s niche and starve off the new company to protect microsoft s market others argue that the outcome of the case harms technological innovation due to fear of being challenged by an anti trust lawsuit appeal on september two six two zero zero zero after judge jackson issued his findings of fact microsoft appealed to the supreme court however the supreme court declined to hear the appeal and sent the case to a federal appeals court the d c circuit court of appeals unanimously overturned judge jackson s rulings against microsoft on browser tying and attempted <UNK> on grounds that he gave off the record but nevertheless disclosed interviews to the news media during the case and that judge jackson having opinions about the defendant was improper judge jackson s response to this was that microsoft s conduct itself was the cause of any perceived bias microsoft executives had proved time and time again to be inaccurate misleading evasive and <UNK> false microsoft is a company with an institutional disdain for both the truth and for rules of law that lesser entities must respect it is also a company whose senior management is not averse to offering <UNK> testimony to support spurious defenses to claims of its wrongdoing however the appeals court did affirm in part judge jackson s ruling on <UNK> the d c circuit <UNK> the case for consideration of a proper remedy for drastically altered scope of liability that the court had upheld under judge colleen <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> now under the administration of u s president george w bush announced on september six two zero zero one that it was no longer seeking to break up microsoft and would instead seek a lesser antitrust penalty settlement on november two two zero zero one the <UNK> reached an agreement with microsoft to settle the case the proposed settlement required microsoft to share its application programming interfaces with third party companies and appoint a panel of three people who will have full access to microsoft s systems records and source code for five years in order to ensure compliance however the <UNK> did not require microsoft to change any of its code nor prevent microsoft from tying other software with windows in the future on august five two zero zero two microsoft announced that it would make some concessions towards the proposed final settlement ahead of the judge s verdict on november one two zero zero two judge <UNK> <UNK> released a judgment accepting most of the proposed <UNK> settlement nine states and the district of columbia which had been pursuing the case together with the <UNK> did not agree with the settlement arguing that it did not go far enough to curb microsoft s anti competitive business practices on june three zero two zero zero four the u s appeals court unanimously approved the settlement with justice department rejecting objections from massachusetts that the sanctions are inadequate the dissenting states regarded the settlement as merely a slap on the wrist some people in the computer industry agreed with dissenting states especially those who advocated open source and alternatives to microsoft many believed that free market competition can only be restored by government intervention to break up the microsoft monopoly others believe that government intervention is <UNK> to free market principles maintaining that microsoft was not and is not a coercive monopoly industry <UNK> robert x <UNK> believes a breakup is not possible and that now the only way microsoft can die is by suicide andrew chin an antitrust law professor at the university of north carolina at chapel hill who assisted judge jackson in drafting the findings of fact wrote that the settlement gave microsoft a special antitrust immunity to license windows and other platform software under contractual terms that destroy freedom of competition microsoft s obligations under the settlement expire on november one two two zero zero seven criticisms of the case some critics of the antitrust proceedings against microsoft assert that they were an unjustified assault on a business that held a large market share merely by <UNK> its rivals some hold that the case against microsoft was the result of <UNK> between government and microsoft s competitors in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage by <UNK> the free market through government coercion nobel economist milton friedman believes that the antitrust case against microsoft set a dangerous precedent that foreshadowed increasing government regulation of what was formerly an industry that was relatively free of government intrusion and that future technological progress in the industry will be impeded as a result moreover friedman says that antitrust laws do more harm than good and should not exist strict free market advocates believe that the only type of monopolies that should be 
dismantled are coercive monopolies and reject the claim that microsoft falls in this category jean louis <UNK> e ceo of be inc which at the time made a competing operating system which eventually folded in the face of microsoft s dominance provided a series of criticisms against the antitrust suit these criticisms were levelled at the <UNK> on the packaging problem microsoft wasn t really making any money off the sales of internet explorer and its reason for incorporating it into the operating system was because the consumer expected to have a browser packaged with the operating system indeed beos came packaged with its web browser <UNK> instead he argued microsoft s true <UNK> clout was in the <UNK> it offered to <UNK> preventing other operating systems from getting a foothold in
